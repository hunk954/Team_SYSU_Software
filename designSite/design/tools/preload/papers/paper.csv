In this paper, we propose a novel artificial pathway for microbial production of vanillyl alcohol from simple carbon sources. The pathway extends from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), and needs only three heterologous enzymes, p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PobA), carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and caffeate O-methyltransferase (COMT). First, we examined the promiscuous activity of COMT toward 3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol and found a kcat value of 0.097 s–1. Meanwhile, 499.36 mg/L vanillyl alcohol was produced by COMT in vivo catalysis when fed with 1000 mg/L 3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol. In the following experiment, de novo biosynthesis of vanillyl alcohol was carried out and 240.69 mg/L vanillyl alcohol was produced via modular optimization of pathway genes. This work was to date the first achievement for microbial production of vanillyl alcohol. Additionally, the present study demonstrates the application of enzyme promiscuity of COMT in the design of an artificial pathway for the production of high-value methylated aromatic compounds.","aromatic compounds,caffeate O-methyltransferase,enzyme promiscuity,microbial synthesis,shikimate pathway,vanillyl alcohol","Zhenya Chen,Xiaolin Shen,Jian Wang,Jia Wang,Ruihua Zhang,Justin Forrest Rey,Qipeng Yuan,Yajun Yan"

In this work, we applied optogenetics to control cell differentiation and new tissue formation. Specifically, we engineered an optogenetic “on” switch that provides permanent transgene expression following a transient dose of blue light illumination. To demonstrate its utility in controlling cell differentiation and reprogramming, we incorporated an engineered form of the master myogenic factor MyoD into this system in multipotent cells. Illumination of cells with blue light activated myogenic differentiation, including upregulation of myogenic markers and fusion into multinucleated myotubes. Cell differentiation was spatially patterned by illumination of cell cultures through a photomask. To demonstrate the application of the system to controlling in vivo tissue development, the light inducible switch was used to control the expression of VEGF and angiopoietin-1, which induced angiogenic sprouting in a mouse dorsal window chamber model. Live intravital microscopy showed illumination-dependent increases in blood-perfused microvasculature. This optogenetic switch is broadly useful for applications in which sustained and patterned gene expression is desired following transient induction, including tissue engineering, gene therapy, synthetic biology, and fundamental studies of morphogenesis.","angiogenesis,cell transplantation,light-inducible,myogenesis,optogenetics,recombination","Lauren R.

Then, we port these sensors into a gut‐adapted probiotic E. coli strain, and develop a method based upon oral gavage and flow cytometry of colon and fecal samples to demonstrate that colon inflammation (colitis) activates the thiosulfate sensor in mice harboring native gut microbiota.

The SOS pathway is composed of a network of genes under the control of the transcriptional repressor, LexA. Activation of the pathway involves linked but distinct events: an initial DNA damage event leads to activation of RecA, which promotes autoproteolysis of LexA, abrogating its repressor function and leading to induction of the SOS gene network. These linked events can each independently contribute to DNA repair and mutagenesis, making it difficult to separate the contributions of the different events to observed phenotypes. We therefore devised a novel synthetic circuit to unlink these events and permit induction of the SOS gene network in the absence of DNA damage or RecA activation via orthogonal cleavage of LexA. Strains engineered with the synthetic SOS circuit demonstrate small-molecule inducible expression of SOS genes as well as the associated resistance to UV light. Exploiting our ability to activate SOS genes independently of upstream events, we further demonstrate that the majority of SOS-mediated mutagenesis on the chromosome does not readily occur with orthogonal pathway induction alone, but instead requires DNA damage. More generally, our approach provides an exemplar for using synthetic circuit design to separate an environmental stressor from its associated stress-response pathway.","DNA repair,LexA,mutagenesis,SOS pathway,stress response pathways","Jeffrey M.

Herein, we describe components for the establishment of bacterial microcompartments as production chambers in C. glutamicum. Within this study, we optimized genetic clusters for the expression of the shell components of the Citrobacter freundii propanediol utilization (Pdu) bacterial compartment, thereby facilitating heterologous compartment production in C. glutamicum. Upon induction, transmission electron microscopy images of thin sections from these strains revealed microcompartment-like structures within the cytosol. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to target eYFP to the empty microcompartments through C-terminal fusions with synthetic scaffold interaction partners (PDZ, SH3 and GBD) as well as with a non-native C-terminal targeting peptide from AdhDH (Klebsiella pneumonia). Thus, we show that it is possible to target proteins to compartments where N-terminal targeting is not possible. The overproduction of PduA alone leads to the construction of filamentous structures within the cytosol and eYFP molecules are localized to these structures when they are N-terminally fused to the P18 and D18 encapsulation peptides from PduP and PduD, respectively. In the future, these nanotube-like structures might be used as scaffolds for directed cellular organization and pathway enhancement.","bacterial microcompartments,C.glutamicum,metabolic engineering,propanediol utilization,protein encapsulation","Isabel Huber,David J.

Broad utilization of this strategy will require new approaches for implementing sophisticated functional programs, such as sensing and responding to the environment in a defined fashion. Toward this goal, we investigated whether our self-contained receptor and signal transduction system (MESA) could be multiplexed to evaluate extracellular cues, with a focus on elucidating principles governing the integration of such engineered components. We first developed a set of hybrid promoters that exhibited AND gate activation by two transcription factors. We then evaluated these promoters when paired with two MESA receptors and various ligand combinations. Unexpectedly, although the multiplexed system exhibited distinct responses to ligands applied individually and in combination, the same synergy was not observed as when promoters were characterized with soluble transcription factors. Therefore, we developed a mechanistic computational model leveraging these observations, to both improve our understanding of how the receptors and promoters interface and to guide the design and implementation of future systems. Notably, the model explicitly accounts for the impact of intercellular variation on system characterization and performance. Model analysis identified key factors that affect the current receptors and promoters, and enabled an in silico exploration of potential modifications that inform the design of improved logic gates and their robustness to intercellular variation. Ultimately, this quantitative design-driven approach may guide the use and multiplexing of synthetic receptors for diverse custom biological functions beyond the case study considered here.","biosensor,computational model,genetic circuit,intercellular variation,mammalian,receptor engineering","Rachel M.

However, many metabolic disorders are functionally linked while developing distinct diseases that are difficult to treat using a classic one-drug-one-disease intervention scheme. For example, hypertension, hyperglycemia, obesity, and dyslipidemia are interdependent pathologies that are collectively known as the metabolic syndrome, the prime epidemic of the 21st century. We have designed a unique therapeutic strategy in which the clinically licensed antihypertensive drug guanabenz (Wytensin) activates a synthetic signal cascade that stimulates the secretion of metabolically active peptides GLP-1 and leptin. Therefore, the signal transduction of a chimeric trace-amine–associated receptor 1 (cTAAR1) was functionally rewired via cAMP and cAMP-dependent phosphokinase A (PKA)-mediated activation of the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB1) to transcription of synthetic promoters containing CREB1-specific cAMP response elements. Based on this designer signaling cascade, it was possible to use guanabenz to dose-dependently control expression of GLP-1-FcmIgG-Leptin, a bifunctional therapeutic peptide hormone that combines the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and leptin via an IgG-Fc linker. In mice developing symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, this three-in-one treatment strategy was able to simultaneously attenuate hypertension and hyperglycemia as well as obesity and dyslipidemia. Using a clinically licensed drug to coordinate expression of therapeutic transgenes combines drug- and gene-based therapies for coordinated treatment of functionally related metabolic disorders.","synthetic gene circuits,prosthetic networks,gene regulation,gene expression","Haifeng Ye,Ghislaine Charpin-El Hamri,Katharina Zwicky,Matthias Christen,Marc Folcher,Martin Fussenegger"

To this end, we developed an ultraviolet B (UVB)-inducible expression system by designing a UVB-responsive split transcription factor based on the Arabidopsis thaliana UVB receptor UVR8 and the WD40 domain of COP1.

To establish orthogonal regulators for use in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), we chose TFs from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We established a library of 106 different combinations of chromosomally integrated TFs, activation domains (yeast GAL4 AD, herpes simplex virus VP64, and plant EDLL) and synthetic promoters harboring cognate cis-regulatory motifs driving a yEGFPreporter. Transcriptional output of the different driver/reporter combinations varied over a wide spectrum, with EDLL being a considerably stronger transcription activation domain in yeast than the GAL4 activation domain, in particular when fused to Arabidopsis NAC TFs. Notably, the strength of several NAC–EDLL fusions exceeded that of the strong yeast TDH3 promoter by 6- to 10-fold. We furthermore show that plant TFs can be used to build regulatory systems encoded by centromeric or episomal plasmids.

We constructed a set of NOT gates by designing five synthetic Escherichia coli σ70promoters that are repressed by corresponding sgRNAs, and these interactions do not exhibit crosstalk between each other.

However, CRISPRi has yet to be exploited in CHO cells. Here we constructed vectors expressing the functional CRISPRi system and proved effective CRISPRi-mediated suppression of dhfrtranscription in CHO cells. We next generated stable CHO cell clones coexpressing DHFR, the model protein (EGFP), dCas9 and gRNA targeting dhfr. Combined with MTX selection, CRISPRi-mediated repression of dhfr imparted extra selective pressure to force CHO cells to coamplify more copies of dhfr and egfp genes. Compared with the traditional method relying on MTX selection (up to 250 nM), the CRISPRi approach increased the dhfr copy number  3-fold, egfp copy number  3.6-fold and enhanced the EGFP expression  3.8-fold, without impeding the cell growth. Furthermore, we exploited the CRISPRi approach to enhance the productivity of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)  2.3-fold. Our data demonstrate, for the first time, the application of CRISPRi in CHO cells to enhance recombinant protein production and may pave a new avenue to CHO cell engineering.","cell engineering,CHO cell,CRISPRi,DHFR,MTX selection,protein production","Chih-Che Shen,Li-Yu Sung,Shih-Yeh Lin,Mei-Wei Lin,Yu-Chen Hu"

Biol., 2017,6(8), pp 1554–1562",5.382,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00056,http://pubs.acs.org/covergifs/asbcd14/title.gif,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a useful eukaryotic host organism for studying GPCRs as monomolecular models. Fluorescent reporter gene assays for GPCRs provide a convenient assay for measuring receptor activity using fluorometric instruments. Generally, these assays detect receptor activation by agonistic ligands as the induction of fluorescent reporter expression, whereas antagonistic activities are detected by competition with agonistic ligands, resulting in decreases in fluorescence intensity. In the current study, we established a system for inverted expression of a fluorescent reporter by incorporating a PEST-tag and finding out a promoter inhibited by activation of the GPCR signaling pathway from yeast endogenous promoters. Because agonists prevent fluorescent reporter expression in this system, antagonists compete with agonists and yield increased fluorescence intensity. We used the yeast endogenous pheromone receptor as a model GPCR to demonstrate the feasibility of our system for positive detection targeted at antagonists. Compared to results when only agonists were added to yeast cells, more than 10-fold higher fluorescence intensity was observed when antagonists were added in combination with agonists. The approach described here has the potential to markedly accelerate the identification of GPCR antagonists by providing rapid and straightforward responses.","antagonist,G-protein-coupled receptor,inverted expression system,PEST sequence,yeast","Nobuo Fukuda,Misato Kaishima,Jun Ishii,Shinya Honda"

Biol., 2017,6(8), pp 1596–1604",5.382,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00119,http://pubs.acs.org/covergifs/asbcd15/title.gif,"Synthetic biology aspires to develop frameworks that enable the construction of complex and reliable gene networks with predictable functionalities. A key limitation is that increasing network complexity increases the demand for cellular resources, potentially causing resource-associated interference among noninteracting circuits. Although recent studies have shown the effects of resource competition on circuit behaviors, mechanisms that decouple such interference remain unclear. Here, we constructed three systems in Escherichia coli, each consisting of two independent circuit modules where the complexity of one module (Circuit 2) was systematically increased while the other (Circuit 1) remained identical. By varying the expression level of Circuit 1 and measuring its effect on the expression level of Circuit 2, we demonstrated computationally and experimentally that indirect coupling between these seemingly unconnected genetic circuits can occur in three different regulatory topologies. More importantly, we experimentally verified the computational prediction that negative feedback can significantly reduce resource-coupled interference in regulatory circuits. Our results reveal a design principle that enables cells to reliably multitask while tightly controlling cellular resources.","biological robustness,negative feedback,protein sequestration,regulatory architecture,resource competition","Tatenda Shopera,Lian He,Tolutola Oyetunde,Yinjie J.
