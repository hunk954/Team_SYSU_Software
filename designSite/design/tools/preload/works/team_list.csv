","Detection and identification of microbial contaminations on hard surfaces are vital to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections and to alleviate the pressure on health care systems. Existing techniques pose limitations, as they do not combine effective, economical and rapid detection. The Cellock Holmes project aims to tackle these challenges all at once. By combining native microbial sensing systems, such as quorum sensing, with open source biology, hardware and software, a novel two-dimensional biosensor is developed. Cellock Holmes’ simple, modular and open design enables the end user to test solid surfaces for microbial contamination without any expensive equipment or highly trained personnel. The working concept is demonstrated using one of the most prevalent human pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The versatile biosensing system, however, can be easily customized to detect other pathogens as well.

","Climate change is argued to be one of the greatest challenges faced by mankind. Its primary cause is believed to be man-made CO2 emissions from transportation and electricity production. To tackle the issue of transportation emissions, we want to produce sustainable propane in Escherichia coli using cellulosic feedstock. The pathway is a patchwork of 10 different enzymes from different organisms, such as Mycobacterium marinum and Bacillus subtilis. We built a model of the pathway to identify its bottlenecks and concentrate our engineering efforts on them. To elevate our propane from a food crop -based  first generation biofuel to the second generation, we are integrating a secretion system for cellulose hydrolysing enzymes. To innovatively enhance our production system, we are bringing the two final enzymes of our pathway into close proximity by fusing them with micelle-forming amphiphilic proteins. This increases theoretical yield, bringing us one step closer to commercially viable biopropane.

","Damage to inaccessible pipe systems, such as computer cooling circuits, is difficult to rectify. An Escherichia coli synthetic biology circuit for pipe repair was designed. Pipe breach detection and the restoration of pipe integrity were implemented through exploitation of chemotaxis, and cell lysis that releases a two-component protein-based glue (lysyl oxidase and tropoelastin). Control was achieved using an AND gate with quorum sensing and the lac inducer IPTG (released from the breach) as inputs. Deterministic and stochastic models of the genetic circuit, integrated with an agent-based model of E.coli cells, were used to define the effective radii of cell migration and timing of lysis. Constructed AND gate, quorum sensing and lysis timing modules were experimentally tested. The two-component glue concept was successfully validated using in vitro alpha-omega complementation of beta-galatosidase activity. Finally, a proposal for an igem.org-based parameter database was developed to aid the rapid identifation of BioBricks parameter values.

","Trypanosoma.b. gambiense, the causative agent of Trypanosomiasis (African Sleeping Sickness) infects 30,000 people worldwide, with 60 million at disease risk. Unrecognised, this disease is fatal, but accurate diagnosis, relying on detection of patient serum antibodies against two different trypanosomal antigens, allows successful treatment. We engineered autotransporters Ag43 and ice-nucleation protein to successfully express surface epitopes in E.coli that mimic two different trypanosomal antigens. Two E.coli strains were generated, each expressing a distinct surface epitope and either a quorum sensing (QS) sender or receiver module respectively. Immune pull-down of each strain, and their subsequent co-culture, produced a quorum signal, indicating successful detection of two distinct antibody populations in a serum sample.  We constructed a cheap, Raspberry Pi computer-controlled fluorimeter suitable for developing countries, showing it could detect QS fluorescence output. This novel application of antigen display, and quorum sensing to implement AND logic sensing, facilitates cheap, simple diagnosis of tropical diseases.

","Kopi Luwak coffee is the rarest and the most expensive type of coffee in the world, and is processed from feces of the Asian Palm Civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). As the coffee berries are digested, bitter components of the coffee bean are broken down. Later, the beans are cleaned, roasted, and brewed to make the Kopi Luwak coffee.
The problem with the procedure today is that farming industries keeps tens of thousands of civets living in battery cages, and force-feeds them only coffee berries. As a result of the treatment, the Asian Palm Civet population is declining.
We propose to make this process humane, efficient, and sanitary by instead using bacteria to produce the coffee. We will accomplish this by genetically engineering E. coli with genes for various digestive enzymes, thus simulating the digestive process of the civets with coffee berries so we can finally save the Asian Palm Civets.

Our goal is to design a wastewater treatment system which can absorb the pollutant efficiently while transform it into luminous energy. We plan to use E.coli to design a bacterium that can digest the nitrite and ammonium in its interior using the disposal system from the anammox.

Recently, it was found that their levels are deregulated in various types of cancer. Using bioinformatics analysis, we have identified certain circular RNAs that are down regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. 
So, we are aiming to design a system that can sense CircRNA deregulation in the HCC and respond in a way to restore the balance and equilibrium in the CircRNA environment of the cancer cells. Also, we are evaluating the therapeutic effect  of CircRNA as a potential novel target for the treatment of HCC.

To control the cell cycle, this project relies on a re-engineered chemotaxis system which instead of controlling the flagellar rotation direction drives changes in gene expression in response of the cell community  through the use of a series of on/off switches and a modified serine production pathway which allows between cell communication. Introduced together, these different components will create an oscillator that regularly drives the switch modules between their two states which coupled to color changes will make the cells GO to the other state only when the light is green!!

Synthetic Biology Tool Kit for Artificial Genome Design and Construction
","The creation of simplified artificial cells with specialized functions, along design principles that are compatible with the goals of synthetic biology, requires advances in two key areas. In Silico modelling tools are needed to assess the performance of artificial networks prior to assembly. Genome biofabrication must achieve rates well beyond existing methods using a modular design so that the extent to which natural systems can be made artificial can be tested. We have taken our first steps towards these goals by directing our efforts to the rational refactoring of the E. coli genome. Using flux balance analysis we have identified 117 new genes that may be essential for survival. We have developed and validated a rapid, modular biofabrication method (BioBytes) and have produced BioBytes for 150 of  our 447 essential gene list. We have also built a Lego Mindstorm-based DIY biofab robot and extended the concept to a BioFab-on-a-chip prototype.

","Building DNA is too hard. Democratizing Synthetic Biology will demand fundamental advances to make DNA construction easier and cheaper, thereby enabling broader access to biotechnology by the public. Our team has tackled this challenge with the design of an inexpensive self-contained kit called GENOMIKON, currently targeted for the high school and DIY communities but with clear potential for professional use. The kit contains prefabricated parts that are sequentially assembled on a solid support using cycle times of 5 min./part with a coupling efficiency of ~95%. The parts exist with sufficient diversity and quantity for hundreds of unique experiments. The kit is accompanied by an online resource that serves as lab manual, notebook, information management system and social network for the exchange of ideas. While similar in concept to our last year's project, GENOMIKON differs in most technical aspects and is far superior in performance.

","As a young team composed of high schoolers and junior undergraduates, we selected a project aimed at giving ourselves a firm understanding in the fundamentals of genetic engineering and control. The end goal of our project was to create spatial color patterns using bacteria, such as a color wheel and a rainbow, that required control over several color outputs in response to spatial gradients of chemical inducers. Colour gradients were achieved using a high-copy plasmid that contained both an inducible colour gene and its corresponding repressor. Colour banding was achieved by a novel means of adjusting gene expression through plasmid copy number control that varied from 0 to ~1000 copies/cell as a function of inducer concentration. Note that the rapid loss of plasmid that occurs in the absence of inducer also constitutes a novel and extremely effective safety switch for genetically engineered organisms which might enter the environment.

","Construction of complex circuits is still hampered by ignorance of fundamental principles of genetic circuit design. One key challenge is the isolation of independent genetic components -- genes expressed on the same plasmid (or other DNA molecule) will often unexpectedly interfere with or enhance each others' expression in an orientation-dependent fashion, even if they are nominally isolated by terminators and other motifs. This form of cross-talk may be caused by supercoiling generated during transcription, which has been shown to enhance or repress gene expression depending on the form of supercoiling. To test this hypothesis, we will test whether base pair spacing, terminators, or  DNA ""clamps"" (made from DNA-binding proteins) placed between genes on a plasmid can eliminate their cross-talk. If DNA clamps do isolate nearby transcriptional units, then those clamps may advance the field of synthetic biology by allowing bioengineers to build more predictable genetic circuitry.

","L-tert-leucine is important in developing chiral pharmaceutically active chemicals. Many methods have been used in L-tert-leucine synthesis, but products are usually racemic. Scientists developed enzymatic reductive amination to product L-tert-leucine by using leucine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase.
 
Initially, they used isolated enzymes, which can be disadvantageous for that enzymes are always destabilized in the isolation and purification process. What's more, the cofactor-NADH is rather an expensive raw material, which will enhance the cost. So scientists introduced whole-cell bio-catalysts to L-tert-leucine production. Whole-cell biocatalysts could stabilize enzymes and reduce the addition level of co-factor NADH. 
 
However, the NADH consumption rate does not equal to its regeneration. The criminal is different strength of enzymes, we regulate the efficiency of RBS to control its strength.

","Escherichia coli's optimal growth temperature is 37C. Its growth rate decreases drastically at lower temperatures and growth completely halts below 7C.The aim of our project is to increase the cold tolerance of E. coli by expressing and combining several chaperone proteins that are normally found in psychrophillic bacteria. Chaperone proteins are essential in maintaining correct protein folding following changes in temperature. Therefore, expressing these proteins will likely enable enhanced growth rates at temperatures below 37C and shift the minimal growth temperature down from 7C, possibly even allowing growth near 0C.Our project is fundamental in its nature, but any application outside the labs, from biofuel production to bio-sensors, will benefit from the ability of icE.coli to grow at low temperatures, since this will relieve the burden and costs of maintaining the temperature constant at 37C.

In light of this we have created an innovative DNA-methylation based reporter system in E. coli, named Cellular Logbook, that has the potential of simultaneously reporting on significantly more signals than current fluorescence-based systems (eg. GFP). 

The Cellular Logbook can be used to detect and store the presence of any compound linked to a transcriptional regulator. This system allows for offline monitoring by functioning as a memory module. Assessment of the memory status is performed by digesting with restriction endonucleases followed by gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the Cellular Logbook is able to infer the time of signal-onset or signal-intensity using the natural dilution of the registered signal’s due to cell division. 

In short our exciting new memory module could potentially be utilized as a platform for many groundbreaking technologies.

","Many bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to regulate group behaviors, such as bioluminescence and virulence, by sending and receiving small molecules called homoserine lactones (HSLs). Bioengineers have incorporated QS networks into genetic circuits, using HSLs to connect logical operations. However, higher-order genetic circuitry is inhibited by “crosstalk,” in which one QS network responds to HSLs produced by another network. In addition to making it challenging to engineer with multiple QS networks, crosstalk has the dangerous potential to activate virulence pathways in pathogenic bacteria. Using a system that decouples “Senders” from “Receivers,” we are exploring how QS networks from different species behave and which networks have crosstalk. Our project adds 21 new plasmids for QS-based communication, including 12 novel QS proteins, to the iGEM Registry, helps to deepen the knowledge of bacterial communication, explores biosafety implications of engineering with HSLs, and empowers bioengineers to build more complex genetic circuits.

","Response systems possess great significance in the validation of designed systems in the current state of synthetic biology. This year we, team AUC_Turkey, focused on the improving of response system. In our appraisal, we recognized that it would perhaps be easier to degrade dye instead of producing fluorescent proteins or pigments.


In our new response system, the module will primarily be transparent and will change color according to enzyme activity thus creating a distinction between the initial and secondary modules. The process will allow a relatively faster response through the cleavage of the enzymes. The usage of different types of enzymes will result in differentiation in the cleavage and through the examination of the color; it will be possible to make find an equivalent match on the scale.

","Heat management and regulation is one of the biggest issues of 21st Century. Especially after the development of the refrigeration technologies, the world has adapted to thermo-regulation systems in real-life application, industry and science. This continuing adaptation has led to the dependence on temperature wise systems and their maintenance. The system we wish design in this occasion hopes to combat the issue of heat regulation that contests scientists and firms alike. 'Mr. Pyrofrost' will maintain the temperature of the system at a specific temperature through the functioning of two inversely affecting reactions regulated by the temperature of the system itself. The system stimulates an endothermic reaction pathway in higher temperatures and an exothermic reaction pathway in lower temperatures with one system inhibiting the other during function. The heat conditions of the system will both affect the functioning of 'Mr. Pyrofrost' and also be regulated by 'Mr. Pyrofrost'.

","The widespread use of caffeine (1,3,7–trimethylxanthine) and other methylxanthines in beverages and pharmaceuticals has led to significant environmental pollution. We have developed a novel detection and bioremediation strategy for caffeine contamination by refactoring the methylxanthine degradation operon native to Pseudomonas putida CBB5. Escherichia coli cells with this synthetic operon degrade caffeine by N-demethylation to the guanine precursor, xanthine. Cells deficient in guanine biosynthesis and containing our refactored operon were addicted to caffeine; their growth density was limited by the availability of caffeine. Remarkably, they were able to sense the caffeine content of several common beverages. Characterization of nearby genes in the P. putida operon revealed a potential methylxanthine regulatory system for use in biological circuit design. The synthetic N-demethylation operon could be useful for cheaply producing pharmaceuticals or precursor molecules and for detoxifying waste so that it can be recycled into animal feed and biofuels.

","Expansion of the genetic code has the potential to add novel functionality and chemistry to biology. Typically, expansion occurs via reassignment of the amber stop codon.  When reassigned, this codon results in incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) not normally found in proteins.  Such ncAAs can grant new functionality, including photocrosslinking, photocaging, novel bonding or binding sites, and fluorescence.  One part of our project creates an “Expansion Pack Reporter Kit”.  This kit uses a fused fluorescent reporter, containing an N-terminal RFP domain, a C-terminal GFP domain, and an amber codon-containing linker sequence that connects the two domains.  While the RFP domain is translated and fluoresces under all conditions, the GFP domain is only translated when the ncAA is incorporated within the linker.  Failure to incorporate the ncAA leads to translation termination, and thus no GFP fluorescence.  This allows us to accurately assess the rate and fidelity of ncAA incorporation.

","After an organism is reprogrammed with a genetic device, the device will often mutate, or “break”, decreasing the metabolic load on the organism and giving it a competitive advantage. This commonly allows the organism with the broken genetic device to dominate the population, undermining the purpose of the original reprogramming. Our goal is to characterize sequences within genes and plasmids that are more likely to mutate, since our research suggests that certain devices are more easily broken than others. We expanded on this research by transforming four E. coli strains with fluorescent protein plasmids. Breaking times varied noticeably between strains, suggesting that the host’s own genetic material also influenced device stability. Based on our findings, we decided to increase the stability of a few genetic devices, including the pDCAF3 plasmid, which the 2012 UT Austin iGEM team designed to allow E. coli to measure caffeine content through caffeine metabolism.

One common problem producers face is ethanol overproduction by Lachancea fermentati, making the kombucha alcoholic. This study screens L. fermentati using YPD agar plates with bromothymol blue, which changes color with changes in acidity. The color change allows for low-ethanol producing colonies to be selected for and recapitulated into the microbial community. Another issue for some would-be consumers is the taste of kombucha. By codon-optimizing an Arabadopsis gene for bacteria, Gluconobacter and Gluconoacetobacter can be transformed to produce brazzein, a sweet-tasting protein, thus sweetening the kombucha. Furthermore, these chassis organisms will be transformed with a GFP gene and pH-activated promoter to create a time-lapse of the changes that kombucha’s microbial community undergoes.

","""Biosensors have widespread applications ranging from diagnostics to environmental monitoring. Vibrio cholerae's ToxR system can be used as a component in biological devices capable of detecting a wide variety of molecules. A periplasmic domain causes ToxR homodimerization, activating transcription of the ctx promoter. By replacing the periplasmic domain of ToxR with existing or engineered ligand-dependent homodimers, we hope to link ToxR dimerization (and gene expression) to the presence of specific ligands. Initially, ToxR constructs proved to be toxic to E. coli. To address ToxR toxicity, we screened microarray data for promoters that exhibited stress-based down regulation. We constructed a negative feedback system with the rffGH promoter, which permits the use of potentially toxic proteins like our various ToxR chimeras. By fusing existing or engineered ligand dependent homodimers to ToxR, this modular system can be applied to develop new biosensors. ""

","Many applications in synthetic biology demand precise control over subcellular localization, cell morphology, motility, and other such phenotypes that are only observable via microscopy. At present, engineering these properties is challenging due in large part to the inherent throughput limitation imposed by microscopy. We have developed a strategy that enables high-throughput library screening with microscopy by coupling a unique fluorescence signature with each genotype present in a library. These MiCodes (microscopy barcodes) are generated by targeting combinations of fluorophores to several organelles within yeast, and they eliminate the need to isolate and observe clonal populations separately. MiCodes can potentially scale to library sizes of 10^6 or more, and their analysis can be largely automated using existing image processing software. As a proof of principle, we applied MiCodes to the problem of finding unique pairs of protein-protein interaction parts.

","The world consumes over 40 million kilograms of indigo annually, primarily for dyeing denim. Indigo is currently derived from petroleum using a high energy process, and commercial dyeing involves the use of reducing agents to solubilize the dye. The development of biosynthetic and bioprocessing methodologies for indigo dyeing could have environmental and economic advantages. By combining the biosynthesis of indigo and the use of the natural indigo precursor indican, we propose a more sustainable dyeing method as an alternative to chemically-reduced indigo in the large scale production of indigo textiles. We achieved in vivo indigo production in high titers, and efficient cleavage of indican using a non-native glucosidase. Inspired by natural systems, we isolated and characterized several plant and bacterial glucosyl transferases hypothesized to produce indican. Lastly, we compare the cost and environmental impact of our alternative with the present chemical process.

","Three crucial activities in synthetic biology are the creation of standardized parts, the construction and specification of devices from these parts, and the automatic assembly of these devices. Each of these activities requires software tools. Tools give users access to data as well as provide algorithmic support and abstraction to design large scale systems. We have created three software tools for these tasks. The first is a domain specific language called Eugene for the specification of biological constructs and rules for their creation. The second contribution is a visual design environment for device creation called Spectacles. Finally, we have created workflows for the Kepler design environment. This work is integrated within the Clotho design framework. We show that together they offer a powerful solution to the problems of today while also providing a path to the more exotic design activities of the future.

By altering the iron homeostasis of E. coli, we want to increase the total iron level of the cytosol. By sequestering iron in a ferritin protein, iron crystals are formed and the cell is detoxified. 
We will work with other metal binding proteins such as metallothioneins and phytochelatin synthases in order to create ferromagnetic crystals. Furthermore, we will search for the optimal conditions which yield the most efficient formation of magnetic nanoparticles in E. coli. Once we have discovered the best way to magnetize E. coli bacteria, we will build and characterize suitable BioBricks that can be used to remote control the cellular movement of E. coli.

","iGEM Berlin is trying to clear our water of plastics, which pose a threat to our environment. In detail, we are focusing on microplastics present in various everyday products, which find their way into the wastewater treatment plant before ending up in the oceans. Now we are constructing the Enzymatic Flagellulose to degrade microplastics into biodegradable compounds.
It consists of a surface made up of cellulose, which acts as a biocompatible carrier, to which bacterial flagella will be immobilized via a cellulose-binding domain. The single flagellum subunits, also known as flagellin, will be interlinked with plastic degrading enzymes. 
Using flagella as a scaffold for enzymes has two major advantages. Firstly, it enables the creation of a three-dimensional reactive nanostructure that has an increased specific surface with highly catalytic activity. Secondly, flagella may consist of various different active sites, which will enable the combination of multiple enzymatic steps in close proximity.

","Despite recent treatment advancements, cancer is still a major cause of mortality worldwide. One of the fundamental problems preventing the development of effective therapy is the difficulty to target cancer cells exclusively. In Boomerang, we're engineering a genetic device based on a simple concept of AND logic gate: the activation of our CRISPR/Cas9-based system is dependent on the existence of two cancer-specific promoters that control the expression of Cas9 and gRNA, and the combination of these two will occur only in cancer cells. CRISPR/Cas9 system allows several applications of Boomerang: 1) disruption of genes essential for cancer survival; and 2) activation of suicide genes, or color proteins for cancer cell detection (e.g., for complete surgical removal). Our system can be potentially designed according to unique characteristics of a patient's tumor, paving the way to personalized medicine. We hope that our strategy will change the approach to cancer treatments.

Many solutions are available, but their side effects are damaging the environment due to plastics toxicity. As plastic was only recently introduced to nature, native biodegradation solutions are not sufficient to overcome the massive amounts of plastic debris in oceans and land. 
Our goal is to improve biodegradation solutions using synthetic biology tools, from force evolution of a polyethylene degrading bacterium, through protein engineering of PET degrading enzyme, to genetically engineering a metabolic pathway that will enable our selected bacteria to consume PET as a sole carbon source. 
Moreover, utilizing the high energy stored in PET, electrons released from PET oxidation will be immediately harnessed at an anode of a biofuel cell for electricity production. Thus, our project will provide a clean, productive and energy efficient process for plastic biodegradation.

","The supply with electricity is facing three major problems: the storage of electricity, the increasing amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the development of alternative energy sources. Therefore we want to implement a proof of concept for the production of the biofuel isobutanol from carbon dioxide. 
A bacterial microcompartment originated from cyanobacteria, called carboxysome, is used to realize the fixation of carbon dioxide in Escherichia coli. Within this microcompartment the carbon dioxide fixation is enabled under aerobic conditions. The needed energy for this process is provided by electricity. The electrons are transferred with a mediator into the cells and its uptake is empowered by different modifications of E. coli, like over-expression of the fumarate reductase. This concept is realized in a self-constructed bioreactor. Finally the production of isobutanol is established by hetereologous expression of various enzymes from different species.

As the starting point of our system, we design a library of sequences encoding binding proteins in E. coli. Afterwards, we use a special DNA-Polymerase, for increasing diversity through error-prone replication of the desired sequence. Finally, binding proteins with high affinity to the target protein are selected. This selection is mediated by protein-protein interaction, granting a selective advantage to cells in which tight binding proteins are expressed by an increase in fitness under selective pressure.

","Taurine is a pseudo-aminoacid derivative of cysteine  which can be obtained naturally by some foods, biosynthesized by some organisms or produced through a series of chemical reactions. Taurine synthesis is an important process as it plays many roles in the functions on the human body, among other organisms. The main aim of our project is to successfully introduce a couple of enzymes into E. coli’s genome so it can biosynthesize this important molecule. To achieve this, these two taurine-pathway enzymes were selected: cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) and cysteine dioxygenase (COD). It is important to highlight the fact that it’s the first time we synthesize both of them using synthetic biology techniques.

","Manufacturing functionalized proteins in vitro poses a challenge, as it requires coordinated molecular assemblies and multi-step reactions. In this project we aim to control, over time and space, the production of proteins tagged with a silver-binding peptide for in situ silver nanoparticle nucleation inside microdroplets generated by microfluidic devices. Combining a transcription-translation system with protein coding genes and a recombination logic inside microdroplets provides spatial control. Moreover, in the microfluidic chamber we can pinpoint the beginning of synthesis, and easily track and isolate the droplets. Site-specific recombination generates a molecular timer for temporal control of protein synthesis. Unlike transcriptional regulation, this method gives true all-or-none induction due to covalent modification of DNA by Flp recombinase. Determining the transfer curve of inter-FRT site distance versus average recombination time allows the onset of gene expression to be predicted. We then apply this Flp reporter system as a powerful PoPS measurement device.

","SensorBricks is a reliable and modular system for antigen recognition, signal amplification and quantification. Initial steps of SensorBricks will focus on the detection of CD33 and other leukemic markers to increase diagnostic stringency. There are three major components in SensorBricks: (i) monoclonal antibodies that bind to an antigen of interest, (ii) a LuxI-Protein A fusion construct which non-specifically binds antibodies and produces the autoinducer N- Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL), and (iii) a Escherichia coli based biosensor which strongly amplifies the production of a fluorescence protein in the presence of AHL. By coupling signal detection to a genetic circuit, we would be able to amplify the signal in a quantifiable manner, allowing the identification of cancer markers expressed in minute quantities.

","Many diseases remain endemic in the developing world due to a lack of advanced laboratory equipment and trained medics. Although diseases such as multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), leprosy and syphilis primarily pose a threat to those living in the world’s poorest countries at present, increasing globalisation is rapidly transforming these diseases into a worldwide problem. This issue can only be addressed by developing an affordable diagnostic method that requires minimal training.


Enterobacteria phage lambda is a well-characterised virus of Escherichia coli, which has previously been used in the development of biotechnological tools. We aim to use this bacteriophage as the basis of a modular chassis with a variable host range. To facilitate identification of host cells in patient samples, these bacteriophages will deliver a chromoprotein gene into cells and drive expression, allowing diagnosis of a range of bacterial diseases by the simple observation of different colour changes.

To make the magnification controllable, a lacO operator regulated by lacI was assembled in downstream as a control block (controller), by adjusting the concentration of IPTG. With this block, several sensors of materials including but not limited to antibiotics are able to be enhanced controllable. This year, a sensor of beta-lactam newly designed and one of tetracycline are applied to detect the residual of antibiotics in milk which endangers human health.

This bio-lock, likened to a digital combination lock, allows bacteria to grow only if three different inducers as password is put in order. To realize the code function three layered AND logic gates combined with sRNA system are built up. The corresponding sRNA selectively inhibits gene expression in AND gates to control the order of the password. MIN system is re-designed to inhibit cell division, which will be turned on to maintain the strain to a low density. In a word, locked bacteria are allowed to grow only when the input is correct; thus strains would remain low density and are effectively locked up.

","A reliable, yet easily adaptable mechanism for controlling protein activity is key to most areas of life and medical science research. Still, the most common approaches suffer from various flaws. iGEM Bonn 2013 aims to overcome these drawbacks by engineering a novel tool based on blue light-inducible degradation of targeted proteins.
The use of a modified ClpXP protease system allows a significant increase in rate and scale of activity change while keeping the modification of the target protein to a minimum. Combining this system with a tool for photo-activatable heterodimerisation based on a LOV domain results in a superior tempero-spatial control.
To demonstrate the capabilities of our device, we designed a photosensitive kill-switch. This contributes to the security of synthetic biology in such a way that bacteria accidentally brought out of a safe work environment, for example a red-light-hood, would be killed by sunlight within a short period of time.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae we plan on overexpressing the Curdlan synthase gene (FKS1) to maximize production, while in Escherichia coli we will be inserting three genes: the Curdlan Synthase gene (crdS), and two genes which assist the transportation of nascent polymers in the cell (crdA and crdC). We then plan on optimizing the production and sulfating the Curdlan molecules since it has been shown that this enhances its protective capacities.

In contrast, strategies that exploit post-translational regulation of activity, such as conditional dimerization of split protein halves, have been demonstrated to bypass these limitations. Here, we compare the relative efficiency of previously characterized dimerization domains in regulating activities of three important genetic manipulation proteins - integrases and recombination directionality factors for genetic logic applications, and saCas9 for in vivo genome editing applications. We also establish guidelines to rationally identify promising protein split sites. Our characterization of these systems in mammalian cells ultimately paves way for important biomedical applications.

using CRISPR-dCas9, capable of specifying varied exogenous gene expression levels based on

different signals. We first developed digital elements by pairing gRNAs with minimal operator

promoters and using dCas9 to transactivate. We then created analog elements by multimerizing

operator sites to obtain graded activation levels. Finally, we integrated our digital and analog

characterized and optimized our system in human cells, enabling synthetic biologists to better

Microfluidic devices can greatly facilitate many biological experiments. However, they are not widely used due to high manufacturing costs and expertise required to use them. Our project improves accessibility to microfluidic hardware development within the synbio community through an intuitive platform to design and build simple continuous-flow systems. Neptune’s user interface allows researchers to easily specify high-level designs. It then validates, optimizes, and produces customized parametric blueprints of the setup. It guides users through manufacturing microfluidic chips and hardware at a cost orders of magnitude less than conventional methods. Users can then control and automate experiments through Neptune’s framework. Neptune is available as an open source project to the entire iGEM community as well via the Nona Research Foundation, laying the groundwork for capturing the advantages of microfluidics in essential experiments and applications in the synbio community.

","Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which is characterized by alterations in kidney functions and structure, affects millions of people worldwide and a large portion of them is unaware of it. Absence of symptoms in early stages leads to a late diagnosis when patients need dialysis or even transplants. Currently, CKD is diagnosed by measuring creatinine levels in blood, which in turn are detectable only at late stages of renal dysfunction as well as are sensitive to factors such as diet, gender, ethnicity, age, muscle mass. We report the development of a biosensor that can diagnosis CKD in its early stages, identifying a biomarker named Cystatin C. Using a cell surface biosensor as detector and quorum-sensing system as transducer and response mechanism, we developed a genetic circuit that establishes a threshold, differentiating concentration ranges of Cystatin C. We envisioned it as a fast, simple and reliable tool for CKD screening and diagnosis.

We engineer three different E. coli strains to grow in a consortium exploiting different Quorum Sensing systems. Each strain maintains a constitutive expression of an inactive transcription activator (LuxR, LasR or RhlR). Inducers are synthesized by different synthases (LuxI, LasI or RhlI) that are each expressed in one strain and subsequently secreted into the medium.

On an industrial scale, this chemical induction requires large quantities of reagents and extensive purification, while environmental induction requires conditions that can adversely affect cell vitality and yield. To this end, we have designed an E. coli genetic circuit that can pass through four stable states of protein production triggered solely by ON/OFF patterns of light. To efficiently test the components of our circuit, we have also created a system for the transient delivery of transcription factors through the cell and nuclear membranes. With this production method, we can link multiple synthesis steps to a single, clean and rapidly scalable input.

","""One of the major challenges of space exploration is the enormous cost of launching materials, limiting the size and affordability of long-term missions. Synthetic Biology can revolutionize space exploration and settlement by providing a microbial platform for catalyzing critical reactions and manufacturing essential products. Biological devices have a major advantage over classical machines: the ability to self-replicate and regenerate.Project RegoBrick uses bacteria to cement Martian and Lunar regolith simulant into a concrete-like compound. Extraterrestrial settlements will be able to use such a process to build structures using resources readily available in the environment, instead of having to transport materials from Earth.Project PowerCell develops a universal energy source from engineered cyanobacteria, which generate carbon and nitrogenous nutrients from sunlight and air and secrete them to sustain other microbes. This system will allow future settlers to transform resources on other planets into fuel, food, drugs, and other useful products.""

To achieve this, we design a bio-system-recombinant luminous Escherichia coli to which diverse bio-sensors are transformed. Then we ascertain the quality of water by analysis the light intensity which correlated to the expression of lux gene reflecting comprehensive toxicity and multi-FP genes indicating specific toxicities. All these test data are analyzed in a algorithm we designed which give feedback in the form of report including referable information. Furthermore, adding microfluidics to this system will make the trace and fast test possible.

This defines a new level of modularity allowing the increase of the complexity of the system by moving to the community level.
We′ve come up with several plausible circuits designs and in silico predictions and decided to build a “crossfeeding” system in which each strain produces and secretes an aminoacid the other strains need to grow.  We characterized two auxotrophic yeast strains (for tryptophan and histidine) and designed novel biobricks that regulate the export of Trp and His rich peptides. 
In the future this would allow for other modules to control the proportions of each strain, thus allowing dynamic and stimulus dependent changes in the abundances of each strain.

","Our project is focused on developing a biosensor specific for certain water pollutants, with a modular and scalable approach. This approach would make it easy to adapt the response for the detection of different substances. In contrast to other iGEM biosensors, it does not rely on expensive equipment or qualified people to interpret the results. Being aware that most of the populations affected by consumption of contaminated groundwater don’t have scientific or technical training, we intend the device to be cheap and easily distributed. We have designed it in a way that any user could easily determine the presence and level of the contaminant on drinking water, using image-based instructions. The project will focus on measuring a primary pollutant: arsenic. However, its modular and scalable design provides an easy way to measure various contaminants such as nitrate/nitrite among others.

","The DIY bio community has developed a number of open source, inexpensive designs for laboratory equipment necessary for synthetic biology, but the prices of commercial DNA polymerases remain a significant financial hurdle for labs operating on shoestring budgets. Founding members of the Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS) began to address this problem in the 2010 iGEM competition, developing a Biobrick for Taq polymerase synthesis. BUGSS has built on this earlier work, developing a new Biobrick for Pfu DNA polymerase, which offers a replication error rate approximately 6 fold lower than that of Taq. The development of this Biobrick began with the amplification and cloning of the pol gene for Pfu DNA polymerase from contaminant DNA in a commercial stock enzyme.

","Production and exportation of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus as a lyophilized substance is a major activity in the Bulgarian economy. In our project we are developing a novel strain of L. bulgaricus, which is capable of withstanding desiccation and freezing. To achieve that we are introducing exogenous proteins responsible for survival of harsh conditions under the control of inducible promotors. For example, we will utilize IDP’s and LEA proteins from tardigrade responsible for the notorious capacity of that organism to sustain dryness. As another option, we envision to test trehalose production as a method to increase survival rate during lyophilization. Additionally, we will also apply expression of spider silk genes, known for their capacity to improve the capacity of organisms to withstand extreme conditions. For better control and reduction of expression loading of the chassis, we shall utilize inducible promotor such as PLux or PBAD.

","Humans rely on carbon resources for nutrition and energy.  Through industrialization we have become dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  Recent research into renewable biofuels has included work on the production of corn-based ethanol and the microbial degradation of cellulose from terrestrial plants.  Biofuels derived from these sources are not fully sustainable.  Third generation biofuels include those derived from microalgae.  Cyanbacteria are microalgae known to fix carbon dioxide into alkanes through the collective processes of photosynthesis, glycolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis.  The CAPS iGEM Team 2013 begins metabolic engineering of these pathways by expressing a rabbit muscle derived pyruvate kinase, known to be a key regulator of glycolysis, within the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC 6803 in an effort to increase alkane production.  Pathways will be modeled using TinkerCell and assays for the production of pyruvate, fatty acids, and alkanes will be used to characterize our system.

This year we developed E. coli capable of simultaneously sensing lactate, heat and ROS, implemented a novel Cre-Lox system, and constructed a library of thermosensors.  Our project uses two circuits, each with a unique reporter.  The first circuit contains a RNA thermosensor driven by a ROS-inducible promoter, allowing expression of Cre recombinase when both heat and ROS are present.  Although heat is transient, Cre ensures continued expression of the first reporter gene.  The second circuit contains a periplasmic lactate sensor coupled to a second reporter.  Finally, we have evolved a library of thermosensors that work in a narrow physiological range.  Together, this two-circuit system may allow accurate and specific detection of early colon cancer cells.

","Bacteriophages are the most abundant organism on the planet, yet most are still uncharacterized. Current research is focused on finding new ways to use bacteriophage either in their wild-type state or after they have been modified for use in synthetic biology.   We studied two ways to modify existing well-characterized bacteriophages. First, we employed random mutagenesis, CsCl purification, and plaque-size selection to isolate T4 and T7 bacteriophage with altered capsid sizes. A library of capsid sizes will allow researchers to select the appropriate bacteriophage for use in biotechnology or nanotechnology applications.  Second, we designed a cholera sensing and destruction circuit using bacteriophage lambda.  In this circuit, lambda contains biofilm-degrading enzymes controlled by a cholera quorum-sensing system transferred to E. coli.  Upon sensing cholera, this E. coli will activate lambda, leading to cell lysis and biofilm degradation. This research demonstrates the versatility and utility of bacteriophages in the field of synthetic biology.

We have designed a system that can accurately and visually report whether a gene is being transcribed and/or translated. The system also differentiates whether expression is failing due to misfolding in the periplasm or cytoplasm.  In the case of misfolding, our system can also fine tune expression levels of a given protein to optimize production, increasing the likelihood of obtaining functional protein.  To further understand protein misfolding we have built an equation-based, multivariant model of inclusion body formation.  Finally, we used a series of podcasts to explore the social implications of our project in the context of the growing synthetic biology industry.

","Our goal for the was to create and print a bioplastic, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), from soybean oil using E. coli. Our proposed design uses a radical crosslinking reagent to crosslink PHB monomers in cell lysate, released upon a light-induced lysis gene network. We hope to apply this printing ability to three-dimensional printing, offering a cheap alternative to current rapid-prototyping technologies. Our work involves characterizing an infrared promoter for light-lysis, experimenting with PHB production in cells, and the design of a dual-wavelength printing system. We discuss how this system could be generalized to create a framework for actuating groups of cells in any 3D volume to theoretically modulate behavior more complex than lysis. We also plan to apply special consideration to the ramifications of possible commercial enterprises developed in iGEM competitions with open source biological materials, such as BioBricks .

","""Endocrine disruptors, or substances that mimic estrogen in the body, have detrimental biological effects on the reproduction of several species of fish and birds; the Caltech team focuses on bioremediation of these toxins. Our goal is to create a system housed in E. coli that can be used to process water and remove endocrine disruptors on a large scale. We focus on isolating degradation systems for the common endocrine disruptors bisphenol A (BPA), DDT, nonylphenol and estradiol.  We synthesized known degradation enzymes DDT dehydrochlorinase, BisdA and BisdB, and characterized the behavior of these enzymes when acting on our target endocrine disruptors. In addition, we explored the potential of certain cytochrome p450s to initiate degradation of these chemicals, focusing on WT-F87A degradation of BPA. Finally, we characterized the functionality of E. coli protein processing when E. coli is deployed as an easily containable biofilm on various substances in aqueous environments.""

In parallel, we worked to optimize ethanol production in E. coli by diverting electron flow from normal cell metabolism to alcohol fermentation. We also explored using Zymomonas mobilis, a more efficient ethanol producer, as an expression host for our biodegradation enzymes.

We also aimed to improve the spatial and temporal control of bacterial behavior. We modified the coliroid system to produce a degradable output, allowing a bacterial image to change over time. With this animated coliroid, we worked to create an interface between digital animation and biology using a simple light projector.

","While there exist many well-characterized genetic circuits in synthetic biology utilizing intracellular genetic regulation, the implementation of methods governing intercellular regulation—that between two different cells—has lagged behind in comparison. To investigate the viability of independent, non-interfering cell-to-cell signaling, we attempted to implement non-endogenous bacterial quorum-sensing systems from various Gram positive bacteria in E. coli, in hopes that successful transfer of these systems into E. coli will promote enhanced prototyping of intercellular signaling and regulation in synthetic biology’s favorite model organism. To this end, three separate quorum sensing systems—agrBDCA, lamBDCA, and fsrABC—were investigated. We constructed various cell strains expressing separately the signaling and receiving components of the quorum sensing systems and measured their efficacy in creating and receiving the signaling molecule.  Treatment of hormonal regulation disorders (e.g. diabetes, Cushing’s disease, etc.) is one of many possible applications of successful creation of circuits implementing intercellular regulation.

","Bioluminescence is one of the most striking spectacles in the natural world.  Taking genes from fireflies and Vibrio fischeri, the Cambridge team have constructed BioBricks which allow light output at a wide range of wavelengths.  Firefly luciferase is already used as a reporter, but requires continual addition of the expensive substrate luciferin.  We have created codon-optimised operons combining luciferase with a luciferin regenerating enzyme (LRE).  This allows recycling of luciferin for sustained light output. In addition, we have submitted the first lux operon to the registry, taking genes from bacteria which form symbiotic relationships with squid.  This is the first BioBrick to emit light without addition of substrate and can be used as a reporter with any promoter. These two approaches will allow cheaper assays with brighter signals.  We also hope they will lay the foundations for natural light sources that help to address the energy crisis facing our planet.

","Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.

We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed.

","The past few decades have seen detection technology change dramatically. The shift from analogue to digital came first. Now, a new change is happening: biosensors are allowing mankind to detect compounds and the environment using genetically-enhanced life forms. However the creation of such biosensors requires deep knowledge and dedicated facilities. What if it were possible to create customised biosensors in the comfort of one's home? 
m?sbi is a modular, open-source biosensing platform developed using a novel, user-friendly plant chassis: Marchantia polymorpha. The m?sbi biosensors consist of 3 modules: input, output and processing. The user is free to mix-and-match the modules to create custom biosensors simply by crossing the chosen modules’ pre-transformed plant lines and collecting the progeny. m?sbi’s open-source nature allows users to create and modify modules ensuring its continuous evolution. In farming, homes, education, and maybe even space - m?sbi will change the way we view biosensors.

An alternative to conventional antibiotics is phage therapy. However, many temperate phage also form prophage. Our approach to antibiotic resistance is to engineer a temperate phage, Lambda, with light-activated production of superoxide. The fluorescent protein KillerRed was cloned into a plasmid vector and lambda gt11 with the IPTG inducible lac promoter. Lysogens were isolated and these strains were characterized and compared to E. coli with KillerRed from high-copy plasmids. Light activation of KillerRed resulted in decreased cell numbers. In addition, we modeled our system at multiple scales, including populations of phage and bacteria, KillerRed gene expression, ROS production, and effects of light. Having two methods of killing, lysis and superoxide, decreases the probability of developing resistance and our system overcomes the prior limitations of using wild-type temperate phages.

","The goal of this project was to construct a biosensor for the hCG hormone consisting of S. cerevisiae. The human luteinizing hormone receptor (LH/CG), a GPCR with high affinity for hCG, was therefore expressed in yeast. The yeast strain used contains a yeast/human chimeric Gα-subunit, enabling coupling of the LH/CG-receptor with the pheromone pathway in yeast. Binding of hCG should consequently result in activation of the pathway. The genes tnaA and fmo, encoding tryptophanase and flavin-containing monooxygenase respectively, were introduced into the yeast strain. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of tryptophan to indigo. tnaA was set under the control of the pheromone induced FIG1 promoter and fmo was expressed constitutively. Hence, detection of hCG should result in the production of bio-indigo, the output signal of the biosensor. In order to ensure hCG to pass the cell wall, the gene CWP2, encoding a cell wall mannoprotein, was deleted.

","Biologically based manufacturing can produce numerous types of complex products. One of the biggest problems is the robustness of the system. Great progress has been made with industrial production techniques, but contaminations are still a considerable problem the industry faces. Insufficient control of contaminations in bioreactors could compromise entire batches, resulting in high expenses. Team Chalmers Gothenburg will solve the contamination problem once and for all using a novel strategy to detect and combat contaminations in yeast based bioreactors. The solution involves two genetic systems, one signaling and contamination detection system and one repair system for survival after contamination termination. These two systems are made from innovative uses of ESDSA repair, CRISPR technology and MAPK cascades. The two systems also set the foundation for a whole range of new applications, from DNA assembly to laboratory markers. More will be revealed in this study in scarlet.

","Current methods of chemical synthesis from petroleum have led to great environmental disruption and continue to be a strong contributor to the emission of carbon dioxide. To overcome this problem, biosynthesis is the most viable alternative. The main drawback of biosynthesis is the high price of raw material, comprising over 60% of the production cost. Our solution for this complex problem is to create a self-sustaining co-culture of microorganisms that produces its own raw material, using light and carbon dioxide. Cyanobacteria provide the carbon source for the production organism, which in exchange produces an essential amino acid for the cyanobacteria while creating the desired product. By making several species compatible with this synthetic symbiosis, the platform will allow efficient conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into products in an environmentally friendly and sustainable way.

To discriminate double-click from two separated single-clicks, the 1st input is to be memorized temporarily. If the 2nd input is added before the memory gets lost, output will be produced. If the 2nd input is not added within the given time, the system will be reset to the original state. This mechanism could work as a sort of safety device; by requiring the 2nd 'confirmation' input, one can drastically reduce, or even eliminate, the frequency of false-inputs.

Tanshinone is an important pharmacologic chemical extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza, a famous Chinese medicinal herb. It was reported that tanshinone can effectively cure Cardiovascular diseases. However, content of tanshinone in Salvia miltiorrhiza and its extraction efficiency are very low. Therefore, synthetic biology becomes the ideal way to produce tanshinone artificially. However, until now, the biosynthesis pathway of tanshinone is not clear. In this research, we aimed to produce one of the key enzymes copalyl diphosphate synthase 1 (SmCPS1) which initiate biosynthesis of tanshinone by building up a gene circuit in plasmid of E.coli. Our gene circuit contains a GST for purification of SmCPS1, a thrombin protease site, our target gene SmCPS1 and the reporter gene GFP.

Our team is using a genetic engineering approach to produce a small consortium of E. coli that should efficiently degrade biphenyl, and it is hoped that this same system can be adapted for the bioremediation of PCBs. Natural bioremediation by native bacterial communities is exceedingly slow due to the recalcitrant nature of PCBs and their hydrophobic properties which reduce the bioavailability to potential catabolizers. We are taking a three-pronged approach in an attempt to increase the efficiency of biphenyl bioremediation—attraction of biphenyl-degrading E. coli by other guiding bacteria, overexpression of the biphenyl catabolic enzymes, and production of a biosurfactant to increase the solubility of biphenyl. Together, this system should significantly increase the rate of biphenyl degradation.

The engineered USA bacteria will recognize a target chemical produced by the pathogen of study, which will trigger a cascade of genes to both amplify the chemical signal and produce a visible alert to the pathogen’s presence. The USA pathogen detection mechanism strives for rapidity, economy, and simplicity.

","While mountain pine beetle are a natural part of the southern Rocky Mountain ecosystem, recent beetle outbreaks are larger than those of the past. Decades of fire suppression have created large tracts of older pine forest that provide a highway for beetle expansion. The lack of fire, combined with a recent warming trend, means that the beetles are now occurring farther east, farther north and at higher elevations than ever before. This is cause for concern as the mountain national parks form the margin between the beetle outbreak in British Columbia and commercial forests in Alberta.

Our project will focus on building a bacterial plasmid that will produce and secrete the chitinase enzyme which will in turn be able to break down the chitin rich membranes of the BSF while leaving the tree unaffected and thus able to use its own defences to deal with the mountain pine beetle.

","Our project is a novel bacterial method of DNA detection. We've developed a customisable, linearised, double stranded plasmid with two sticky overhangs. When the sticky overhangs come into contact with a target sequence, the binding of the DNA sequence to the overhangs circularises the plasmid. The circularised plasmid is then transformed into competent E. coli cells. Bacterial growth of green fluorescent colonies indicates a positive result, confirming presence of complementary DNA target sequence. This system could act as a cheap alternative to digital and real time PCR, as target DNA fragments are amplified in living cells without use of a costly PCR machine. This system could potentially be used as a diagnostic or screening tool for viral and/or bacterial infection such as Human Papilloma Virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. By improving sensitivity and specificity this system could also be used for detection of genetic mutations resulting in disease such as cystic fibrosis.

","The goal of our project is to create a whole cell cadmium biosensor by attaching cadmium responsive promoters in Bacillus subtilis to fluorescent reporter proteins. Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal which has no known biological function. Ingestion of cadmium contaminated water can induce bone fractures and severe renal damage. Major sources of cadmium contamination include fertilizers, sewage sludge, manure and atmospheric deposition. Cadmium contaminated sewage is often used for irrigation purposes in many parts of the world, especially in developing nations. Crops grown in these contaminated soils are then sold in markets without any detoxification treatment. Current analytical methods such as atomic absorption spectroscopy, though highly sensitive, are significantly more expensive than bacterial biosensors and are unable to measure the amount of bioavailable cadmium.

","Fracking is a common method for extracting natural gas and other fossil fuels from the ground, but it requires the use of many hazardous and carcinogenic compounds.  In Colorado, ground water contamination from fracking has endangered many communities’ safe drinking water.  To address this environmental health issue, we developed a biosensor to detect naphthalene, a common reagent in fracking.  Naphthalene detection and output signal amplification can be achieved using the Lux promoter and the Bxb1 integrase. Our biosensor uses a naphthalene induced promoter located upstream of the BxB1 integrase.  Once expressed, Bxb1 acts on a logic gate to express RFP. A Lux cell-cell signaling system from V. fischeri will enable our system to be more sensitive at low concentrations. Our biosensor could be housed within a stake-shaped device, containing a pump to obtain ground water and a live culture box kept at homeostatic conditions.

","The IOD band is a general diagnostic test enabling early detection and mapping of tumor mobility. Over a billion unique tests are made accessible to field experts outside of synthetic biology with a unique clone-free assembly feature. Tumor mobility is incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the rarity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and the complexity of surface marker combinations. The IOD band strives to make it easy. The central players are processing units called Input Output Diploids or IODs. IODs use antigen recognition and intercellular communication to create a logical network by which even single cells carrying the desired marker profile can be identified in a background of millions. Affirmative CTC localisation triggers a global response manifested by IOD initiated clumping at levels visible to the naked eye. As such, IOD bands do in a test tube what normally requires days to do in the lab.

","Dwindling fuel resources and rising environmental concerns have catalyzed the development of biofuel production in microorganisms. In Nova Scotia, softwood waste from the lumber industry is an untapped source for low-cost biofuel feedstock; however, this waste cannot be utilized by traditional biofuel processes due to toxic compounds such as turpentines and unavailable carbon compounds such as cellulose. The porcupine microbiome provides a unique solution as it is capable of digesting bark and toxic products. Working with Schubenacadie Wildlife Park, we aim to not only identify cellulose and/or turpentine-degrading bacteria in the porcupine microbiome, but to also characterize microbial communities found within the Park’s mammal population. To achieve these goals, we are using fecal samples to construct a DNA library of the porcupine and to analyze each mammal’s microbial rRNA. Future experiments include introducing identified cellulose and/or turpentine-degrading pathways into E. coli to produce an economically viable and sustainable biofuel-generating organism.

","The Project's Goal:
Develop an innovative biological method for identifying gluten in food.

The focus is on developing a gluten binder protein. Principles - A protein changes conformation in response to ligand binding coupled to a reporter gene. The Gln_H protein is a protein which is able to detect glutamine. The two ends join a half-reporter enzyme called HAD. each half of the enzyme is attached a molecule such as color coded GFP. When the Gln H comes into contact with glutamine the closed ends, when the two halves of HAD enzyme connect the enzyme becomes active, followed by a color reaction which can be seen by the human eye. The source HAD enzymes comes from TERMOTOGA MARITIMA ,This bacteria is found in regions of hot springs and is therefor an extra Thermopile bacteria, and its enzymes are very stable.

","We focused on the Knapsack Problem which asks, 'Given a set of weighted items and a knapsack of fixed capacity, is there some subset of these items that fills the knapsack?' Weighted items are represented by TetA alleles that confer measurably distinct levels of tetracycline resistance in E. coli. Excess TetA kills the cells; insufficient TetA can be screened by plating on tetracycline plates.  Each TetA allele is coupled with a distinctive fluorescent gene, and both are flanked by variant lox sites. Cre protein can invert or excise floxed DNA, yielding different combinations of expressed TetA alleles.  We constructed different TetA alleles by altering codon optimization and characterized the consequence of changing the order of two genes (TetA and RFP). Furthermore, we designed and tested a total of 11 new lox sites for site specific recombination.  We developed several open access software tools for the wider synthetic biology community.

","Eukaryotic synthetic biology has huge potential, yet it is still in need of more diverse molecular tools for defined gene regulation. Nuclear receptors are a conserved family of proteins responsible for sensing lipids; they may be viewed as lipid activated transcription factors. We have successfully developed a kit with a variety of lipid responsive domains (from H.sapines, D.melanogaster and C.elegans) for the rational construction of synthetic transcription factors. The domains respond only to predefined lipids and selectively activate predetermined gene expression. To characterize theses domains, we used standardized protocols for comparable measurements. In vivo gene expression was measured as a function of ligand concentration using luciferase activity. The potential for these tools is immense; e.g. from the ultra sensitive detection of lipid contaminants in the environment to the opportunity of titration specific gene expression canges in patients undergoing gene therapy.

NHRs bear high homology to each other and are modular into distinct regions: N-terminal regulatory region, DNA-binding domain, a Hinge region, Ligand binding domain (LBD) and a C-terminal region. Some Nematode NHRs can be activated by extracted oil contamination of the soil so they can use as possible oil sensors in the future. Zinc finger motifs are the tools of NHRs to bind DNA and regulate gene expression directly. These tiny elements can be tested as direct gene regulators. Controlled gene induction can also lead to programmed cell death which is a less harmful tool in order to quit non-functionable cells.""

Health clinics in resource-poor settings face significant challenges with quality and standardization of medications. Our project uses yeast to detect the presence of a specific medication, oxytocin – a naturally occurring hormone and medication that prevents postpartum hemorrhage during childbirth – the leading cause of maternal mortalities worldwide. Unrefrigerated oxytocin has a half-life of ~3 minutes, and only 8% of samples tested in a 2012 study in Ghana were kept at the appropriate temperature. Expired, low-quality, and unavailable medications are common occurrences throughout the developing world, but little is known about the impact on maternal outcomes due in part to the lack of low-cost diagnostic tests. Our interdisciplinary community lab has also built many of the tools we use in our lab every day emphasizing our commitment and motivation to continue working on creating robust low-cost biological tools and systems that can be deployed and used in economically underdeveloped areas.

They are synthesized by modular, high molecular weight enzymes that assemble more than 500 different amino acid substrates in an assembly line manner. For this reason, synthetic biologists have tried to engineer these proteins and to switch modules to create analogs and novel natural products, but with little success. Despite being modular, the interactions between modules have evolved to be highly specific, making synthetic  Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPS) a challenge to engineer. Instead of switching modules we introduced a recombination system targeting oligo integration in Bacillus subtilis. We used the recombineering system to alter the active sites determining substrate specificity, thereby creating variants of antibiotics. Our focus was the tyrocidine antibiotic, which cannot be used intravenously due to its toxicity. Our goal is to create new analogs through multiplex automated genome engineering to reduce toxicity.

The controller interface is made with emphasis on interoperability and applications in mind. Specifically, we use zinc finger repressors and degradation tags to reduce cross-talk and make the network more robust.

","Alzheimer’s and other hereditary conditions are caused by small mutations in key genes. Medical genetics focuses on screening and treatment of hereditary genetic disorders. However, current high throughput screening methods are time consuming and extremely limited by cell growth rate and rate of gene activation. In order to address these issues we’ve created an optogenetic tool kit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the CIB1/CRY2 optogenetic system. In this system, the CIB1-VP16AD and CRY2-Gal4BD fusion proteins dimerize in the presence of blue light leading to gene expression at the Gal1 promoter. Using flow cytometry we characterized four different fluorescent proteins for use in our tool kit using a galactose activation assay. After characterizing our network, also using flow cytometry, we developed several protein expression assays for medical genetics. Finally, in order to confirm network success in silico, we utilized the modeling software TinkerCell to generate a stochastic model of our optogenetic network.

","Synthetic gene circuits have the potential to revolutionize gene therapies and bio-industrial methods by allowing predictable, customized control of gene expression. Bistable switches and oscillators, key building blocks of more complex gene networks, have been constructed using naturally occurring and well-characterized regulatory elements. In order to expand the versatility and variety of these circuits, we designed and constructed gene networks using artificial transcription factors (ATFs). The ATFs are of two classes: inhibitory TAL proteins and a catalytically inactive dCas9 protein with small guide RNA elements, each orthogonal to the yeast genome. Using mathematical modeling, we determined the parameters expected to create bistability and oscillation, using tandem binding site kinetics to achieve cooperativity. Based on these results, we assembled a library of plasmids containing ATFs, binding sites, regulatory elements, and fluorescent reporters. We then integrated these genes into the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are currently characterizing them using flow cytometry.

If a sequence is present, dCas9 will titrate away from a synthetic binding site upstream of a report gene to the desired sequence. In our project, we looked at this gene circuit in the context of detecting antibiotic resistance to activate a cell death gene.

This toxin causes liver damage and is also speculated to be a carcinogen. Microcystin’s toxic action lies in its ability to bind to the human Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is a major regulator of cell division, protein synthesis and other essential processes. Using synthetic biology techniques, we engineered bacterial chassis (E. coli and B. subtilis) to express PP1, which covalently binds to microcystin. The engineered bacteria can then be used as a molecular mop, the ToxiMop, to remove microcystin from contaminated water. Applying mathematical modelling to our experiments, we optimised our prototype ToxiMop. Additionally, we attempted to develop a biological detector for microcystin, which was combined with our electronic device, the Moptopus.

","  Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a serious problem in the medical community. Detecting antibiotic resistance quickly is crucial to determine the correct treatment for different patients and for setting up quarantines to prevent spreading. We hypothesized that is possible to use quorum sensing (QS) to devise a rapid way for cells to report the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here, we developed a reporter cell that expresses GFP in the presence of the QS signaling molecule acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). Our test cells (which act as a simulation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) express lactonase, which breaks down AHL. In our experimental system, test cells should signify their presence by breaking down AHL and preventing GFP expression in reporter cells. Therefore, our project serves as a proof of principle and we hope that our work will serve as a basis for developing similar, more sophisticated quorum sensing-based detection systems in the future.

By running PCR, we were able to amplify the DNA involved, and by analyzing this, we could come up with a better understanding of how the multidrug resistance works.

To address this issue and extend research to modestly-funded settings, we propose Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 as an alternative vehicle that harnesses E. coli’s transformative powers while obviating the need for costly apparatus. A reporter gene, E. coli gusA was ligated into each of our shuttle vectors; the ligation mixtures were used to transform A. baylyi. Transformed cells formed blue colonies on media containing histochemical substrate X-gluc, indicating that A. baylyi can be used instead of E. coli particularly when refrigerated centrifuges and ultra-cold freezers are unavailable. We hope our findings can enable genetic engineering in modestly-funded laboratories and bring more diversity to the field of synthetic biology.

Two external inputs - red light and far red light - induce the relocation of the fused proteins, thus reversibly changing flagella movement direction.

It has a boiling point of 20.2C and is very volatile, thus can be used as an information carrier through air. The SmoColi cells are immobilized in an agarose-filled microfluidic device. The test solution is fed on one end of a microfluidic channel, in which an acetaldehyde gradient is established by synthetic cellular degradation. The cells are engineered to sense acetaldehyde by a synthetically re-designed fungal acetaldehyde-responsive transactivator. The sensor is linked to a band-pass filter that drives GFP expression. This allows establishment of an input-concentration-dependent, spatially located fluorescent band displaying quantitative information about acetaldehyde. Finally, if the acetaldehyde concentration exceeds the threshold of malignance, a quorum-sensing-based mCherry alarm system springs into action, turning the whole device red.

","E.colipse is an intelligent and adaptive sun radiation protection system which responds to UV exposure with the production of the protective agent pABA.
To detect hazardous levels of sun radiation our system is based on UVR-8, a UV sensing protein from plants. 
In its dark state, this protein forms a homodimer that dissociates upon UV radiation.

We fused UVR-8 with the DNA binding domain from TetR, which is unable to dimerize and to bind DNA in monomeric form. UV-exposure might force the TetR-UVR8 fusion dimer to split, release the DNA and enable transcription. Thus, TetR-UVR8 might act as a light-activated on-switch in bacteria.

We plan to use this novel switch to start the production of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), a common ingredient of sunscreen, and - dependent on the intensity and duration of exposure as determined by our detailed in silico model - a colored pigment as a visible warning signal.

","Colisweeper is an interactive, biological version of the Minesweeper computer game, based on luxI/luxR quorum sensing and chromogenic enzymatic reactions. The goal is to clear an agar “minefield” without detonating mines. Genetically engineered Escherichia coli colonies are used as sender-cells (mines) and receiver-cells (non-mines). Mines secrete the signaling molecule N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (OHHL) whereas non-mines process the signal. To distinguish between OHHL-levels, a library of PLuxR promoters with various sensitivities was created through site-saturation mutagenesis. High-pass filters were constructed to control the expression of different orthogonal hydrolases in non-mines, depending on the number of surrounding mines. Additionally, the mines express their own hydrolase. A spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion model was established to evaluate and improve the system. To play Colisweeper, a colorless substrate solution is pipetted onto a colony of choice. The result is a defined color change within minutes, allowing identification of the played colony and the number of mines surrounding it.

","Emergence of complex patterns in nature is a fascinating, widely spread phenomenon, which is not fully understood yet. Mosaicoli aims at investigating emergence of complex patterns from a simple rule by engineering a cellular automaton into E. coli. This automaton comprises a grid of colonies on a 3D-printed millifuidic chip. Each colony is either in an ON or OFF state and updates its state by integrating signals from its neighbors according to a genetically pre-programmed logic rule. Complex patterns, like Sierpinski triangles, are visualized by fluorescence after several steps of row-wise propagation. The implementation of quorum sensing based sequential logic computation  is challenged by leakiness and crosstalk present in biological systems. Mosaicoli overcomes these issues by exploiting multichannel orthogonal communication, riboregulators and integrase-based XOR logic gates. Successfully engineering such a reliable system not only enables a better understanding of emergent patterns, but also provides novel building blocks for biological computers.

","
This year, our project focuses on diseases that are subsequent to an iron overload such as hemochromatosis and thalassemia.


Nowadays, iron overload is mainly treated by bloodlettings for hemochromatosic patients but this treatment cannot be extended to thalassemic patients who suffer from anaemia. The aim of our project is to prevent the intestinal absorption of iron by engineering Escherichia coli to produce siderophores, chelators of iron. This strategy acts directly at the source.


We engineer Escherichia coli using the Ferric Uptake Regulation (FUR) couple to an inverter system,  in order to produce these siderophores in presence of iron. To reduce the patient's iron absorption, our bacteria is encapsulated in a pill. Once it arrives in the duodenum, our bacteria will produce the siderophore at their full potential and chelate the iron.

","Our team wants to heighten awareness about environmental pollution and particularly its devastating consequences on the aquatic life. In this line of thinking we are driven to design a bioremediation tool to decrease the marine pollution and protect aquatic ecosystems. We aim at tackling elements of the main pollutant families by focusing on 5 toxic agents: Polychlorinated Biphenyls, nitrite, phenol, lead and cadmium.
The bioremediation tool will be based on Pseudovibrio denitrificans, a bacterium living in symbiosis with Spongia officinalis. Our goal is to engineer the bacterium to detect, signal and degrade/capture pollutants and to bring it as new chassis in the iGEM competition. The project’s originality lies on the duo formed by Pseudovibrio denitrificans and its symbiotic sponge. Combining these two organisms allows for safe containment of the engineered strain while the extensive filtration capacity of the sponge stimulates the optimal sensing, signaling, and capturing of pollutants in water.

To address these issues, our team mainly focused on engineering a S. cerevisiae yeast immunotherapy that was ultimately tested in vivo on mice presenting melanoma. Three complementary strategies were combined: First, in order to modulate the tumor environment, yeast secreting immune modulators, GM-CSF and IFNgamma, were encapsulated into alginate beads and injected in tumors. Secondly, to break the immune tolerance against cancer cells, T4 and T8 lymphocytes were elicited by a yeast antigen display system. Last, to deliver cytotoxic compounds solely in the tumor environment, a yeast hypoxia bio-sensor was designed. A side project consisted in engineering E. coli to drive MAIT lymphocytes against cancer cells instead of their original targets, parasitized cells.

Purification of the his-tagged protein of interest will be accomplished by an adaptor protein of our own design which binds the His-Tag on one side and the surface of serological pipettes on the other. Two subsequent pipetting steps for washing and purification of the cell lysate will quickly elute the product.""

","Transactivator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are a brand-new technology that currently revolutionizes the way researchers manipulate DNA with exceptional site specificity. Originally derived from Xanthomonas spp., this type of protein comprizes an effector domain and a modular DNA binding domain that can be rationally designed to bind to virtually any target sequence of DNA. Over the past two years, universal endonucleases (TALENs) and transcription factors have been tested in various organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.
According to existing protocols, TALE assembly requires several weeks of work and substantial lab skills. In order to bring this technology within reach for iGEM students, we invented an extremely fast and easy TALE assembly strategy and developed a TALE platform with expression plasmids and new classes of TALEs.
With our so called GATE assembly kit, future iGEM students will be able to precisely manipulate genomic loci easier and faster than anyone else in the world.

","Our Team developed a universal toolkit, termed uniCAS, that enables customizable gene regulation in mammalian cells. Therefore, we engineered the recently discovered and highly promising CRISPR/Cas9 system. The regulation is based on the RNA-guided Cas9 protein, which allows targeting of specific DNA sequences.
Our toolkit comprises not only a standardized Cas9 protein, but also different effector domains for efficient gene activation or repression. We further engineered a modular RNA plasmid for easy implementation of RNA guide sequences. As an additional feature, we established an innovative screening method for assessing the functionality of our uniCAS fusion proteins.
Single genes and even whole genetic networks can be modified using our uniCAS toolkit. We think that our toolbox of standardized parts of the CRISPR/Cas9 system offers broad application in research fields such as tissue engineering, stem cell reprogramming and fundamental research.

","In modern medicine, fast detection and differentiation of diseases is a crucial and fundamental task. Typical ELISA-based assays are time-consuming and expensive. We propose an advanced procedure for the simultaneous detection of various diseases in a fast and inexpensive manner, the DiaCHIP.
Our approach is based on the interaction of antibodies with their respective antigens. Different antigens are immobilized on a protein array generated by cell-free protein expression, using the corresponding DNA array as a template. Placed in a microfluidic chamber, the protein array is incubated with a patient’s blood sample. The interaction between an antibody in the sample and the corresponding immobilized antigen results in a local change of the optical thickness of the surface. This change can be detected using a label-free and real-time measurement technology called iRIf (imaging Reflectometric Interference). Offering simultaneous screening for several diseases, our DiaCHIP has strong potential to improve future diagnostics.

","The treatment of diseases while avoiding systemic side effects is still a major obstacle in modern medicine. After administration, conventional drugs are distributed throughout the whole body thus affecting both, diseased and healthy cells. Current strategies on targeted drug delivery are mainly based on the applications of antibody-drug conjugates or nanoparticles. However, both approaches revealed considerable challenges in their application due to short half-life and expensive production, respectively.
We develop a novel platform for targeted drug delivery by  implementing highly specific nanobodies directed against surface markers of affected cells. The combination with an enzymatic functionality facilitates the local activation of prodrugs, thus preventing unnecessary side effects by systemic drug dispersal. By engineering the spores of probiotic Bacillus subtilis, a member of the human microbiome, we establish a low-cost carrier for well-tolerated treatment.

Researchers have managed to use chemical or biological methods to block these ways individually in vitro and achieve remarkable effect on cancer cell, but these could never be turned into practical use. We adopt safe replicative-deficient adenovirus to deliver tandem shRNAs targeted at several metabolic pathways simultaneously, which are driven by cancer-specific promoter. To test efficiency of different ways to assemble shRNAs in series, we also design a switch to control their expression in vitro. This engineered adenovirus, which we called ‘AdVENTURE’ would be a powerful and precise tool among various cancer therapies.

","The methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, is increasingly used as an alternative host for heterologous protein production. P. Pastoris is advantageous because it is able to perform eukaryotic post-translational modifications, produce high yields of recombinant protein, and it is genetically similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (Cereghino and Cregg, 2000). The 2010 Georgia State team believes P. pastoris would be an excellent chassis for the iGEM competition. The purpose of this project is to provide a tool box of parts necessary for the genetic manipulation of this organism. These parts include a variety of promoter systems, multiple selectivity options, and a plasmid backbone. In addition, the tool box will be used to produce a flu virus antigen in P. pastoris as a representation of the applicability of this system. These contributions will enable future users to maximize the use and further explore the incredible potential P. pastoris has to offer.

","Pharmaceutical companies have invested considerable financial resources in developing analgesics. Often, the compounds used in these medicines are naturally occurring, such as aspirin and opoids. In 2012, Diochot et al from the Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire in France, was able to extract and isolate an analgesic peptide found in the African Black Mamba. The peptide, Mambalgin-1, has been shown to have comparable analgesic effects to morphine but does not induce the debilitating withdrawal affects. However, extracting this peptide is expensive and dangerous work. Using a cassette of standardized systems (the pGAPzα expression vectors) in P. pastoris, we sought to produce high quantities of pure, functional proteins in a safe and cost effective manner.

","The GSU iGEM team has been working with the PGAPZα vector system in order to use the vector to artificially produce the peptide Mambalgin-1, naturally found in the African Black Mamba snake venom. This protein is unique because it has the ability to exhibit sensations comparable to morphine, but is less addictive, more efficient, and easier to obtain on a larger scale, if synthesized in a laboratory setting. By ligating the Mambalgin DNA into the PGAPZα expression system, we are able to linearize and ultimately transform the gene of interest into eukaryotic yeast, Pichia Pastoris, allowing the protein to be excreted in its most pure form. The nature of the PGAPZα and Pichia Pastoris successfully provides a smooth transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic expression of the gene; therefore, we have chosen these vectors to effectively isolate and extract our most desired Mambalgin-1 peptide.

","Our goal is to engineer a novel biosensor with a faster readout than is currently available. Many bacteria produce, secrete, and respond to chemicals called autoinducers to monitor population density and to synchronize gene expression, a process called quorum sensing. In quorum sensing based biosensors, detection of autoinducer activates transcription of a reporter gene, which must then be translated and accumulate to detectable levels, which can take two to four hours. In our system, we will use TraR, a protein used in the quorum sensing response of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which dimerizes only in the presence of its autoinducer. We have successfully fused traR to sequence for two separate complementary fragments of GFP. Upon addition of autoinducer, we predict that already accumulated TraR-GFP fragment monomers will dimerize, allowing the GFP fragments to interact and fluoresce. This new approach may drastically reduce the time necessary for future biosensors to produce detectable output.

","We propose an iterative concept mapping framework to assess ethical, legal, social, and environmental outcomes associated with releasing genetically engineered plants beyond the laboratory. We then apply this framework to The Glowing Plant, the world’s first crowd-funded genetically engineered organism. Rather than prescribing a single “responsible” course of action, we enable individual users to decide how much weight to attribute to principles such as the conservation of biodiversity, the preservation of human health and safety, the advancement of entrepreneurship and innovation, and the promotion of social equity. We also invite users to contribute additional principles, providing an iterative mechanism to help guide future decisions. By enabling users to explore the potential implications of their choices, and to compare their own preferences to others’, our model demonstrates how policy decisions depend on value judgments and encourages reflexive thinking about the social, cultural and ethical negotiations involved in technological oversight.

","In Japan, environmental pollution caused by excrement of birds is a problem that should be solved. It causes dieback of trees and spoiling of the cityscape which definitely is not a good sign as long as a healthy environment is concerned.

Birds’ dropping consists mainly of uric acid which is really insoluble. But uric acid can be degraded to soluble material, urea. So, our goal is to single out something that can catalyze the degradation of uric acid to urea and make it possible to wash away by rainwater. We’d like to lead our project to the solution of the pollution.

In this regard, we are considering the purine metabolism pathway concerning three enzymes, urate oxidase, allantoinase, allantoicase, to be synthesized to degrade uric acid.

","A genetic recombinase switch provides irreversible, inheritable and inducible gene expression, which is of great value to the growing field of synthetic biology and iGEM in particular. We attempted to create a recombinase switch which would, in response to arabinose, switch from encoding a flagellar gene, to two genes that encode gas vesicle formation, namely gvpA and gvpC. This switch could be applied to many areas, e.g. desalination, biofuel production and drug production, by simply changing the stimulus that would cause the switch to “flip”. Computer modelling showed that swimming was detrimental to floatation. In response we created knockouts of two different flagellar genes, motA and fliC. In vivo Gvp expression is toxic to E. coli. Instead, we focused on an RFP/GFP switch, which proved that our switch construct is viable. In the future, RFP and GFP can be replaced by any two functional genes that are desirable.

","
Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children and can increase the risk of severe infections by weakening the immune system. To combat this deficiency, our project aims to create a yogurt enriched with β-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. We will insert the required genes to produce β-carotene (four crt genes with a promoter) into S. thermophilus, a lactic acid bacteria used in natural yogurt. We also aim to better characterise S. thermophilus to facilitate its use in synthetic biology.
Our conversations with different stakeholders have led us to design a self-inactivating mechanism to ensure the modified bacteria do not survive in the human GI tract. These interactions also encouraged us to create a piece of accessible hardware to enable people in countries most affected by vitamin A deficiency to manufacture their own yogurt from a starter culture.

","The model organism Escherichia coli is naturally capable of sensing substances in its environment and consequently moves directionally towards these, a phenomenon known as chemotaxis. Here, we apply directed evolution to chemoreceptors by targeting five amino acid residues in the ligand binding site to enable E. coli to perceive novel substances. In order to investigate mobility and directed movement towards a substance, an effective mobility selection method using special “swimming plates” is designed. Additionally, we attempt to improve E. coli’s swimming velocity by creating new parts derived from its own motility apparatus. Based on our selection system, we identify variants of chemoreceptors with new binding specificities in the mutant library. By these means, we aim to train the bacterium to detect new molecules such as tumor cell markers. Once having established E. coli as our “tracking dogs”, the possible applications in medicine but also to environmental issues are virtually countless.

","
Many industrial and biological processes require a range of different enzymes. Our aim is to provide a powerful tool to combine these enzymatic processes. The Flexosome is a multi-enzymatic complex, which ensures higher efficiency and yield from enzymatic reactions. Our construct takes multiple dockerins from a variety of bacteria and connects exchangeable enzymes to a scaffoldin base through automatic assembly. The combination of the catalytic forces of enzymes, derived from different sources, onto one common molecular base creates a synergistic effect. This drives a cascade in which the product of one reaction acts as the substrate for the consecutive one. In the future the Flexosome could, for instance, be used to combine enzymes in washing detergents or even link enzymatic cascades for the production of biofuels. It can therefore be applied from industrial over pharmaceutical to environmental setups.

","Vitamin B12 is involved in metabolic functions in all organisms and is an essential nutrient. It is for example a compound in vitamin pills  and needed for production of various organic substances.  Since the chemical production of Vitamin B12 requires 70 synthesis steps, the production technically challenging and expensive. B12 production is facilitated by  engineered bacterial production strains, which achieve a high product quality. However, the produced Vitamin B12 is not exported by the production organism and is harvested by cell lysis. This prevents a cost efficient production. To date, a natural cellular Vitamin B12 exporter is unknown. We intend to design, construct and introduce a synthetic Vitamin B12 exporter into a production organism. By establishing a Vitamin B12 exporter, we aim for higher yields in the industrial Vitamin B12 production without lysing the cells. Furthermore, the production efficiency of Vitamin B12 production strains should be increased.

","In order to determine the replicative age of a yeast cell, researchers usually rely on direct micromanipulation of daughter cells and bud-scar counting. Given the long generation time of a cell (approx. 90 min), measuring its replicative lifespan is a laborious and time-consuming procedure. The goal of this project is to address this problem with a synthetic biology approach. We design and implement in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a synthetic gene circuit that “colors” mother cells depending on their replicative age. We use a combination of endogenous elements and Crispr/Cas-based transcription factors to induce expression of different fluorescent proteins depending on the number of budding events that the mother cells have already experienced. We foresee that the successful outcome of this project will not only facilitate yeast age determination but will also pave the way to using cell sorters in order to fully automatize the procedure.

","	Mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) are water-resistant bioadhesives that have a variety of biomedical and construction applications. Replicating the natural properties of MAPs through in vivo production using microbes is difficult as it depends on post-translational modifications, primarily the hydroxylation of tyrosine residues to L-DOPA. Since adhesiveness is correlated with L-DOPA content, our project aims to improve the adhesive properties of MAPs by utilizing a strain which inserts the non-canonical amino acid L-DOPA at UAG stop codons during translation. When combined with the in vivo production of free L-DOPA, this system is a significant step towards rapid, cost-effective MAPs production.

	Our team also worked on degrading odorous compounds, computationally modeled the detection of potentially dangerous oligo orders, and created BactoArt using inducible fluorescent proteins. Additionally, we created the Open Sequence Initiative, which is focused on updating the standards for submitting BioBricks to the iGEM Registry.

","Regulated gene expression is one of the primary means by which phenotypic differences are generated among genetically identical cells (e.g., endothelial cells versus nerve cells). Nonetheless, the concept of inducible gene expression is often difficult for students to understand. To help students gain a better understanding of inducible gene expression, we developed ""BactoArt"", a multicomponent, inducible expression system that allows students to visualize gene regulation in action.
First, different fluorescent protein (FP) color variants (e.g., CFP, GFP, or RFP) were placed under the control of specific inducible promoters. The inducers can then be patterend onto a petri dish—using either a paintbrush or an inkjet printer—before plating BactoArt bacteria, leading to selective induction of a given FP. We simultaneously induced GFP and RFP from pXyl and pLac, respectively, and measured their fluorescence intensity over time. We believe that such hands-on activities will spark questions, leading to ""teachable moments"" about transcriptional regulation.

The bacteria sensing a predominance of mercury over IPTG, the 'senders', will release a quorum sensing molecule which is detected by the nearby 'receivers'. The reception of quorum sensing molecules will induce the expression of a red dye in the 'receivers'. In this way, a red line emerges at a position in the IPTG gradient from which the unknown mercury concentration can be deduced.

The amplification system contains a genetic feed forward loop, which filters out false positive outputs. Once amplified and filtered, the signal is transmitted to neighboring bacteria via a diffusible molecule. In turn, the amplification loop is triggered which leads to the production of a measurable fluorescence output.

","Approximately half of all implanted medical devices result in one or more medical complication, which have been found to increase mortality rates by 25%, and to cost the amerian society an additional 30 billion dollars every year. A possible solution for these complications is to form a protective biocompatible layer between the implant and the body by means of a spider silk coating. This is achieved through mathematical modelling, techniques from the synthetic biology, and the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, which is redesigned to secrete silk and to self-assemble into a biofilm surrounding the implant. It uses a modified chemotaxis system coupled to the DesK heat sensing system to do so. B. subtilis is furthermore often used in the industry for the commercial production of extracellular proteins, and is generally regarded as safe.

","Infections caused by  Staphylococcus aureus  and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  often pose problems for burn wound treatments. We developed a new kind of bandage that prevents these infections and reduces the use of antibiotics, thereby lowering the risk of developing antibiotic resistance. The bandage consists of a hydrogel that contains genetically engineered  Lactococcus lactis  with nutrients. The engineered strain of L. lactis  detects the quorum sensing molecules of the two pathogens in the wound and subsequently produces the antimicrobial nisin as well as some other Infection-Preventing-Molecules (IPMs). These IPMs are the anti-biofilm protein Dispersin B and the quorum quenching protein AHLase. The gel is placed between two layers, a top layer to allow diffusion of gases and a bottom layer to contain the bacteria within the bandage. Hydrating the gel by breaking adjacent water pockets initiates the growth of the bacteria, thereby activating the bandage.

","IGEM Groningen 2015 wants to harvest the energy of salt water, also known as ‘Blue Energy’. Blue energy uses ion exchange membranes to separate the sodium and chloride ions found in sea water. The currently used ion exchange membranes are expensive and their efficiency degrades over time . We aim to overcome these disadvantages by replacing those membranes with a bacterial biofilm. The biofilm completely consists of our modified Bacillus Subtilis. 

One of the two types of currently used ion membranes, the cation exchange membrane, only allows passage of positively charged sodium ions. A characteristics of this membrane is its negative charge. In order to generate blue bio energy, we aimed to overexpress genes whose encoding extracellular proteins provide the biofilm with an negative charge and increased rigidity. In result, our biofilm resembling the cation exchange membrane should be able to generate blue energy.

Current diagnostic methods are costly, since they mostly rely on immunologic methods like antibody staining, ranging between 30 to 150 Dollars. This is fine in industrial nations, but for many people in developing countries living close to the poverty line (earning 1.25$ per day) the cost is far from affordable. To combat this, the iGEM Team Hamburg is constructing a fusion protein with a signaling pathway to function as a biosensor in prokaryotes, to subsequently offer an inexpensive alternative to present diagnostic methods for medical doctors in developing countries.

We have designed novel devices to detect these toxic pollutants in waterways called PUPS, or Paper Utilizing Pesticide Sensors.  These devices are paper-based with 3D printed shells, making them very cost effective for use in poor areas worldwide.  The PUPS will utilize a fusion protein that will be produced in E. coli to degrade organophosphates into 4-nitrophenol (4NP), which OPs degrade into naturally over time.  The 4NP will then be reduced in order to electrochemically measure the 4NP concentration at cheap, graphite electrodes.

","""Gene therapy is a powerful approach for the treatment of disease; however, current therapies using viral vectors carry significant risk of tumorigenesis due to their use of non-specific gene insertion. To meet this challenge, we engineered zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), which are tailored to bind to DNA with high specificity, enabling precise genome editing. Our group has developed a foundational technology for synthesizing nearly 50,000 unique ZFPs using chip-based DNA synthesis based on bioinformatic analysis and for identifying the best binder using a novel genomically encoded 1-hybrid genetic selection scheme in a massively multiplexed fashion. Further, we employed multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for facile editing of the E. coli genome enabling rapid modification of ZFP target sites, gene knockouts and silent codon substitutions. These tools allow for low-cost creation of ZFPs targeting any endogenous human gene, which will increase the accessibility of customized genome editing for gene therapy.""

","As a Boston-based team with international roots, we view plastic pollution as both a global and local problem. Thus, we developed a sustainable, circular plastic degradation system that generates energy. We build upon work done by researchers at Kyoto Institute of Technology (Yoshida, 2016), and have engineered E. coli to break down polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which makes up one sixth of plastic products. Terephthalic acid, a byproduct of PET degradation, is then processed in a microbial fuel cell by Delftia tsuruhatensis to generate electricity. UV light, powered by the fuel cell, further contributes to PET degradation. Looking ahead, we hope our work on Plastiback will empower and inspire future sustainable technologies.

","Mammalian synthetic biology has a huge potential, but it is in need of new standards and a systematic construction of comprehensive part libraries. Promoters are the fundamental elements of every synthetic biological system. We have developed and successfully applied two novel, in silico guided methods for the rational construction of synthetic promoters which respond only to predefined transcription factors. Thus, we have been able to create a library of promoters of different strength and inducibility. To characterize the promoters, we have developed standardized protocols for comparable measurements of promoter strength by either transient or stable transfection. These synthetic promoters can be used as “spybricks” which enable the construction of assays for simultaneously monitoring several pathways in a cell. However, the potential of synthetic promoters goes far beyond this application: e.g. in virotherapy, these promoters could be used for selective gene expression in target cells.

","The key to successful gene therapy is integration of tissue specificity and fine-tuned target gene expression. The iGEM Team Heidelberg 2010 unlocks the world of synthetic microRNAs, since focusing solely on DNA has often been inconvenient for medical purposes. We engineered a toolkit for standardized measurements of interactions between artificial miRNAs and their binding sites. From this data we were able to compute an in silico model integrating binding site properties and knockdown percentages. Thus, the expression level of any gene of choice could be arbitrarily adjusted by employing the corresponding binding site design. To produce tissue specific miRNA gene shuttles, we developed an evolution-based method for synthesis of new adeno associated viruses. This enabled us to overcome the natural limitations of virus selectivity. In the future, miBricks could be applied for treatment of diseases like Diabetes and Hemophilia, opening the doors to new Synthetic Biology based medical approaches.

","Biology works with networks of interacting proteins and controlling their functions is fundamental to Synthetic Biology. Conventionally, control depends on gene expression, however modifications made after expression enable fast and precise regulation. Our team has designed a universal toolbox for modifying proteins post-translationally utilising inteins and sortases.

In the natural process of protein splicing auto-catalytic inteins excises themself leaving the flanking chains reconnected. Similarly, sortases identify, cut and rejoin protein sequences. Comprising a variety of standardised parts our toolbox can specifically change whole amino-acid sequences therefore regulating proteins via assembly or protein cleavage.

Very curiously, these methods enable circularisation of enzymes rendering them thermodynamically stable and resistant to exoproteases, which will be applicable in biotechnological procedures requiring high temperatures. Our software selects the best technique for circularisation and a distributed computing platform facilitates the calculations.

","Biology works with networks of interacting proteins and controlling their functions is fundamental to Synthetic Biology. Conventionally, control depends on gene expression, however modifications made after expression enable fast and precise regulation. Our team has designed a universal toolbox for modifying proteins post-translationally utilising inteins and sortases.

In the natural process of protein splicing auto-catalytic inteins excises themself leaving the flanking chains reconnected. Similarly, sortases identify, cut and rejoin protein sequences. Comprising a variety of standardised parts our toolbox can specifically change whole amino-acid sequences therefore regulating proteins via assembly or protein cleavage.

Very curiously, these methods enable circularisation of enzymes rendering them thermodynamically stable and resistant to exoproteases, which will be applicable in biotechnological procedures requiring high temperatures. Our software selects the best technique for circularisation and a distributed computing platform facilitates the calculations.

Taken together we provide a new foundational advance introducing full post-translational modification to Synthetic Biology.

","Like Proteins, RNA folds into a unique, functionally relevant 3D structure – as a catalytic ribozyme or an aptamer detecting and selectively binding a ligand. To obtain these functional RNAs, simple transcription of a DNA sequence is sufficient. Yet finding the few functional sequences has so far been challenging and has impeded its widespread use in synthetic biology. As a part of our project, we develop a software that drastically reduces both required resources and effort of directed evolution, as it creates aptamers for virtually any molecule through computational simulation. With the goal to provide the iGEM community with the power of RNA, we develop a toolbox consisting of easy to use standards for in vitro RNA usage, practical readouts and means for mRNA editing. To reach the end user with our work, we create straightforward tests for the detection of numerous noxious substances.

","Cancerous cells are known to give off volatile compounds (alkanes) that can be detected by trained dogs.  Our goal is to engineer a strain of Yarrowia lipolytica, which is capable of detecting alkanes, to turn color in the presence of these volatile compounds. We hope that we can use this yeast to detect melanoma cheaply and non-invasively (perhaps in a cancer detecting band-aid). To achieve our goal, we will build a reporter construct that uses an alkane sensitive promoter to drive the expression of a blue chromoprotein from the coral Acropora millepora which should cause the yeast to turn blue in the presence of alkanes. Our parts include an alkane response element (3xARE1), a leu minimal promoter, our reporter gene (blue chromoprotein), and a terminator (XPR2). Once the reporter construct is assembled, we will clone it into a Yarrowia lipolytica shuttle vector and integrate it into the yeast genome.

Once the input is sensed, the input promoter triggers hrpR's transcription. The activity of Ptet is constitutive, which means HrpS protein is ample. As HrpR accumulates, HrpS binds to HrpR and form HrpRS which then triggers PhrpL, and tetR and output begin to accumulate. tetR can inhibit Ptet. As a feedback, HrpS and HrpRS will decrease. PhrpL will be of lower activity, so the amount of tetR  and the level of output will decline. The decrease of tetR will enhance the hrpS' expression. All these construct a feedback cycle. Finally, the output will stabilize and be in a certain proportion with the input. By manipulating the RBS of hrpR, hrpS, tetR and output gene, we can control input-output proportion.

The dispersal of toxic anti-tumor chemicals in the circulatory system during conventional cancer treatment prompts us to consider the need of alternative cancer therapies. In an effort to combat with colorectal carcinoma, we aim to use genetically modified Bacillus subtilis to execute targeted drug delivery to cancer cells in the digestive tract, offering an advantage of generating minimal adverse effect on normal colon epithelial cells. Targeting is achieved by expressing RPMrel, a colon tumor specific binding peptide, on the cell wall using a LytC cell wall binding system. The anti-tumor cytokine, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), is synthesized and secreted out from the bacteria with the help of a signaling peptide fused to the protein. To control the timing and amount of BMP2 release, two regulatory systems, xylose-inducible system and ydcE/ydcD toxin-antitoxin system are introduced to minimize the harmful effect from BMP2 overdose.

","To ensure healthy growth of crops, farmers must carefully control the levels of macronutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K)) in their soil.  Currently, farmers monitor soil macronutrient levels with chemical assays.  We hypothesize that PNK biosensors based on genetic circuits refined through millions of years of evolution will measure the nutrients available to a growing plant more accurately.  

We are building on the work of previous iGEM teams on soil biosensors and characterizing new parts. We have developed and tested new nitrate-, phosphate-, and potassium-responsive promoters to produce a colorimetric output in a low input environment and added these parts to the registry.  We are working on deploying our NPK biosensor in a colorimetric cell-free system and in biofertilizer strains of bacteria.

It is our hope that this NPK biosensor technology can be used to optimize the farming and fertilizing process.

","DNA has emerged as a promising material for the creation of novel functional nanostructures. Here we present DNA nanostructures capable of simultaneous detection of multiple microRNA (miRNA) targets which are identified as promising disease biomarkers. Logic gates can be easily incorporated into our designs to test various combinations of miRNA targets. G-quadruplexes form when the specified target hybridize with the probe, generating fluorescence in the presence of substrate. We endeavour to demonstrate intracellular synthesis, self-assembly and functioning of our nanostructures inside E. coli. Our constructs open up new possibilities in future research on DNA nanotechnologies as diagnostic tools, and promote the applications of miRNA testing in clinical conditions.

","While low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to fight with obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism. In a synthetic biology approach, we are working to create an artificial futile cycle in mammalian cell by introducing glyoxylate enzymes native to bacteria. Past research has shown that mice expressing enzymes constituting an active glyoxylate shunt are shown to be resistant to diet-induced obesity. Our team plans to introduce an inducible system that allows us to couple the sensing of circulating fatty acid concentrations with an inducible circuit of glyoxylate shunt. Our inducible system is intended to prevent the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while facilitating greater fatty acid uptake at higher fatty acid circulating concentrations. Such a system should increase the feasibility of a glyoxylate cycle engineered to function in vivo.

","Our team aims at engineering a biological tri-stable switch which shows high orthogonality as bistable switch in Escherichia coli. Building on the Brown 2006 and 2007 iGEM teams’ design, the tri-stable switch which consists of three alternating steady states that can be toggled by three different chemical inducers is improved.
The construct was constructed with three promoters, lacp, phlFp and an ameliorated version of tetp together with their corresponding repressors. This combination enables the switch acting more stably by preventing it from reverting back to its natural states. Mathematical analysis was performed to ensure a stable and robust behaviour of the switch.
Being orthogonal and more stable, the tri-stable switch could be applied in different fields, like biosensing and biocomputing. If the system is further studied and developed, it is foreseeable that it could contribute to the mature integration of different circuits in the future.

Bio-manufacturing commonly involves the culturing of genetically engineered microbes that produce product(s) of interest, which is followed by separation of the microbes from the growth media and finally, isolation and purification of the product(s). The infrastructure and running costs for the downstream processing are significant obstacles to the large scale adoption of bio-manufacturing, especially for small-scale start-ups that drive innovation. We have therefore developed a modular set of tools by designing BioBricksTM for E. coli that firstly cause programmed induction of product synthesis upon reaching a certain tuneable population of cells, and secondly, autoaggregate the cells upon utilization of most of the nutrients available; these eliminate external induction and centrifugation, thereby minimizing costs. This is of special importance in India, where financial constraints often bottleneck entrepreneurial efforts in biotechnology, which is still a field in the early stages of its development.

","Bacterial cellulose is a natural biomaterial that is of interest in many fields due to its high purity compared with plant-derived cellulose. We are optimising cellulose biosynthesis in Gluconacetobacter xylinum, transferring the system to E. coli, and functionalising the material using proteins in order to expand its properties and applications. Bacterial cellulose has seen use in clothing and health foods, but we develop its application to the global issue of water purification. Rising demand for limited freshwater supplies will lead to more than half of the global population suffering severe water stress by 2030. Improved filtration techniques would help relieve this problem. The inherent porosity of cellulose and our synthetic attachment of contaminant-specific binding and catabolic proteins make for a flexible, modular water filter. Our manufactured biomaterial would augment water recycling and reclamation on local and industrial scales, helping to alleviate global water stress.

Our E.coli chassis progresses through a series of defined stages culminating in the production of a safe, inanimate pill. This sequential process involves drug production, self-encapsulation in a protective coating and genome deletion. The temporal transition through each of these stages has been individually optimised by both media and temperature. The E.ncapsulator provides an innovative method to deliver any biologically synthesisable compound and bypasses the need for expensive storage, packaging and purification processes. The E.ncapsulator is an attractive candidate for commercial pill development and demonstrates the massive manufacturing potential in Synthetic Biology.

","Accumulation of waste represents a considerable problem to humanity. Over the next 50 years, the global community will produce approximately 2 trillion tonnes of waste, or 2.5 times the weight of Mount Everest. Traditionally, mixed non-recyclable waste is sent to landfill or for incineration, both of which result in environmental damage. The detrimental effects are perpetrated by the plastic degradation into toxic byproducts and the production of greenhouse gases by these processes. As an alternative we propose to upcycle this mixed waste into the bioplastic poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB) to create a closed loop recycling system. Our engineered E. coli will operate within sealed bioreactors. In the future we picture the use of our system in a variety of contexts as part of our M.A.P.L.E.

A major obstacle, however, is ensuring stable coexistence of different cell types in co-culture. This year we are developing a Genetically Engineered Artificial Ratio (GEAR) system to control population ratios in microbial consortia. GEAR will employ a bi-directional communication system and novel RNA control that can be implemented across different bacterial strains. We are also developing a software to facilitate the design and optimisation of co-cultures. In the future, we envision our GEAR system being used for distributed multicellular biocomputing and bioprocessing, as well as for microbiome engineering.

","""More than two billion people around the world live with unrelenting illness due to parasites"" - WHO Director General Lee Jong-wook. Synthetic biology offers great opportunity for biosensors, however current designs require hours before useful output. To tackle this issue in the field, it's crucial that our project can respond in minutes, hence we have engineered a fast, modular sensor framework. This allows detection of a range of different parasites, and may also be used as an environmental tool for mapping their spread. We have developed two new technologies that enable our modular input/output - a novel cell surface biosensor, customisable for specific parasitic proteases, linked through quorum-sensing to a new 'fast-response' module capable of producing a detectable output in minutes. To demonstrate the concept, we've designed and fabricated B. subtilis to give a striking colour readout upon detecting the waterborne Schistosoma parasite which affects 200 million people worldwide.

","""In an effort to combat soil erosion, we have developed the AuxIn system. This system is comprised of three modules combined in an E. coli chassis. The first involves secretion of the plant growth factor indole 3-acetic acid (auxin). This plant hormone will promote root growth which is essential for anchoring soil. The second module rewires the chemotactic mobility of the cell by introducing a novel receptor protein which is sensitive to root exudates. The bacteria can then be naturally taken up by root cells for targeted auxin delivery. The final module uses a toxin-antitoxin system to prevent horizontal gene transfer. While the plasmid containing the AuxIn system can be maintained inside our chassis, it will induce lysis in any other bacteria.By improving root growth, the AuxIn system provides a synthetic biology approach to tackling worldwide problems such as soil erosion and desertification.

With DNA Origami, self assembling properties organize the DNA strand into patterns by using the local forces to find the lowest energy configuration, which is an Bottom-Up approach. To fold the DNA strand into a well defined structure using DNA staples is an example of Top-Down approach. DNA has many advantages over traditional materials such as biological compatibility, low manufacturing cost and the information regarding shape and size is carried over upon replication. Individual modules are 30-40 nm long 3D Structures with hollow cavity that acts as scaffold for the Gold nanowires. They self assemble into long nanowires and we attached photosystem II protein from the Synechocystis 6803 at one end of the wire to create a high efficiency machinery to harvest solar energy.

- A strict control of the expression of recombinases via a tight riboregulation control of the translation of recombinases genes

","Nowadays, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are commonly found pollutants that have been proved present in a wide variety of everyday life situations. Though they are dangerous and present almost everywhere, VOCs are not efficiently detected. Usual detection devices are very unprecise or requires a very long exposure time. We tried to address this problem by building a biosensor, perfectly adapted to on-field measurements that would allow us to easily and rapidly quantify the amount of VOCs in the air. This biosensor relies on bioluminescence, a biochemical phenomenon that is commonly used in cell imaging. We are trying to develop a new application for bioluminescence that should allow us to create a biosensor of a new kind, entirely different from the existing devices.
We are also working with aeronautical engineers in order to develop a drone able to safely contain our bacteria,that will later be used as a mobile detection platform.

","We present a synthetic network that emulates an activator-inhibitor system. Our goal is to show that spatio-temporal structures can be generated by the behavior of a genetic regulatory network. We implement the model by means of several biobricks. We construct a self activating module and correspondingly an inhibitory one.  Self-activation dynamics is given by the las operon, while the inhibitory part is provided by the lux operon. Quorum sensing and diffusion of AHL provide the reaction-diffusion mechanism responsible for the formation of Turing patterns. The importance of our work relies on the fact that we show that the  action of the morphogenes as originally proposed by Turing is equivalent to the effect of  diffusion of chemicals interacting with the synthetic network, which accounts for the reactive part, a possibility implicit in Turing’s original work in the context of  morphogenesis of biological patterns.

Baker's yeast was chosen because in some sense yeast have a system that responds to voltage input.

We synthesized the violacein pathway, which, combined with our vitamins and intermediate metabolites, represent a new set of yeast reporters. Finally, to assess the potential of VitaYeast to combat hunger in the real world, we have sought IRB approval to distribute an extensive survey on attitudes toward genetic engineering of food world-wide.

","""Our team, KIT-Kyoto challenges making a leukemia disease model in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is being used as many hereditary disease model because over 70% of known human disease genes have similarities to Drosophila genes. This year, we focus on a leukemia in which the etiology and the therapy have not been established. We therefore decided to make a leukemia disease model in Drosophila. We insert human leukemia genes into Drosophila genome and also fuse a green fluorescent protein(GFP) with a leukemic protein to monitor its expression in E. coli or Drosophila. We expect that establishing a leukemia disease model in Drosophila will be a first step to determine the etiology and to establish the method of therapy in future.""

","Drosophila melanogaster has been used for a genetic study as model organism for a long time and brought us much discovery. And we are sure  that the benefit continues from now on.

Therefore we KIT-Kyoto team aim at the production of the disease model Drosophila which expresses the responsible gene of MALT lymphoma that is one of leukemia. It is thought that we can contribute to elucidation of the mechanism of this disease and the development of the therapeutic drug by promoting this project.

In addition, we think about what we can do in order to continue researches using Drosophila melanogaster in the world.
So, this year we aim at the design of the parts with which a study that we use the Drosophila can expand in iGEM in future.
If these projects are realized, the study using D. melanogaster will step forward to the new one step again.

Although the existing researches have already lined up the candidate genes of the DMS biosynthesis pathway, most of them are still unconfirmed. Therefore, we tried to confirm them by introducing 5 candidate genes in Fragilariopsis cylindrus; a diatom, into Escherichia coli. The second project is magnetosome formation. Magnetosome is a specific organelle in magnetotactic bacteria. Although many researchers have focused on it for its unique feature; magnetosome detect magnetic force, they have discovered only magnetotactic bacteria to have this ability so far. So we tried to form the Magnetosome in E. coli by introducing 4 operons which has been lined up recently as the sufficient genes to make magnetosome in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense.

","The concentration of proteins in a cell is determined by both the amount synthesized and the amount degraded. Thus, protein degradation is a crucial aspect of maintaining intramolecular equilibrium. A class of ATPases known as AAA+ Proteins involves a well-known proteolysis mechanism known as ClpXP in which ClpX unfolds and translocates a tagged protein into a sequestered proteolytic compartment in ClpP.

We devised an inducible genetic construct in which ClpXP will degrade a chromoprotein upon induction. The data will be gathered using a device that can quantify the color of the light reflected by the chromoprotein before and after induction. This will ultimately allow us to measure the relative strength of degradation and further characterize a well-known proteolysis mechanism. Our characterization of ClpXP will serve as a precursor for controlled protein delivery in medicines and subsequently a switch for biosensors.

","     Chitin, a polysaccharide derived from glucose, is commonly found in the cell walls of fungi and the exoskeletons of organisms.  Chitosan is derived from chitin through the N-deacetylation process.  Uses include agriculture, medicine, and industry. Research in our local community led us to research applying chitosan in an agriculture setting by preserving post harvest fruit from fungal infections.  Current technology to produce chitosan involves a caustic chemical process that is detrimental to the environment. An alkali sodium hydroxide removes the acetyl group from chitin to produce chitosan. Fortunately, this conversion process also takes place in the natural environment in a multitude of organisms through the aid of an enzyme called chitin deacetylase, or CDA.   The main focus of our project was to obtain a CDA gene from a eukaryotic source, engineer a suitable vector with promoter, and transform into a bacterial host using the standard Biobrick assembly.

We proposed a new approach named gut remediation to reduce bioaccumulated heavy metals in fish by gut microbiota. We designed a polypeptide which can bind to heavy metals including mercury and copper. Then a novel gene Metal Catcher was designed based on the polypeptide with GFP and N-terminal region of INP. Subsequent display of Metal Catcher on the E. coli surface showed highly sensitivity and selectivity of copper, mercury and cadmium, and permitted selective adsorption of copper, mercury. Then, we fed cyprinoid fish with the transformant strains. Result showed that experiment group have lower accumulation of heavy metals compared to the control.

This project introduces a CO-sensing mechanism into E.coli using a CooA transcription activator and corresponding pCoof promoter to regulate the expression of a methyl salicylate pathway (pchBA and BSMT genes).  The pathway converts the endogenous molecule chorismate into salicylic acid then methyl salicylate, producing a wintergreen smell in the presence of CO. This CO sensor has implications for not only the disabled, but also commercial use in cases of natural disaster due to its cost efficiency and transportability.

","Free fatty acids are biofuel precursors.  We focused on using zeaxanthin to counter the toxic effects of increased free fatty acids in an altered Synechococcus elongatus 7942 strain. Zeaxanthin acts as an antioxidant, stabilizes the membrane, and is needed for electron transport chain function. To increase the concentration of zeaxanthin and its precursors, we introduced a circuit containing parts of the zeaxanthin synthesis pathway. The La Ca?ada subset of our team focused on tocopherol, a metabolite that has similar properties to zeaxanthin in cyanobacteria. Tocopherol acts as an antioxidant, protects the cell from lipid peroxidation, and enhances photosynthesis. A circuit was made with the gene p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase to catalyze the formation of homogenistic acid, the rate limiting step of tocopherol synthesis. In an attempt to further increase the production of fatty acids, both zeaxanthin and tocopherol circuits are dynamically regulated, utilizing a fatty acid-sensitive promoter-repressor system, pLR and FadR.

","Objective - Naturally occurring organisms using polystyrene as their sole source of carbon have been recently identified, by analysing the occurrence of polystyrene breakdown products. However these metabolites accumulate very slowly, explaining why polystyrene is so persistent in the environment. Polystyrene can currently be recycled, but due to the low density of the majority of polystyrene products it is economically unfavourable, due to the high energy demands. If inexpensive biological degradation can be achieved this would assist recycling, but we also hope to use products of this reaction to make useful organic chemicals. 

Aim - To construct BioBricks from the genes encoding enzymes involved in this pathway and manipulate their expression and properties to maximise the rate of polystyrene degradation. 

Hypothesis - genes encoding the enzymes of the polystyrene breakdown pathway can be isolated and expressed in a host microorganism and the rate of the process increased by genetic manipulation.

Astrogliosis, a cellular response to such neural insults, leads to the formation of a non-functional “glial scar” and an inhibitory cellular environment that impedes neural regrowth and recovery. Our project involves engineering microglia, the mobile immune cells of the brain, to package and deliver a therapeutic plasmid specifically to central nervous system cells. The plasmid encodes a reprogramming factor that converts reactive astrocytes into new neurons, helping to restore the functional neuronal population and permit regrowth of damaged connections. We have also developed a novel plasmid selection system that bypasses antibiotic-based selection to reduce the size of the reprogramming plasmid. This project has the potential to provide a novel, non-invasive rehabilitative therapy that could lead to significantly improved functional recovery following brain injury or disease onset.

","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a fungal disease that reduces grain yields and seed quality across the world. Fusarium’s airborne spores land on spikelets of flowering crops, producing trichothecene mycotoxins that inhibit cell processes. Gastrointestinal problems and feed refusal in livestock also occur if ingested. However pesticides controlling diseases like FHB have numerous economic and environmental costs.

Our project represents a species specific and widely applicable solution to global agriculture problems using the synthesis of highly pure dsRNA as a topical fungicide. It has been shown that insect midgut cells taking up double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the Dicer enzyme. If the siRNA is complementary to a certain gene, RNAi can silence its expression. This project will target and silence essential Fusarium genes. Our design involves a scaffold where any dsRNA sequence of interest may be inserted for gene targeting within a specific species.

","The prevalence of virulent and multiple antibiotic resistant pathogens in healthcare facilities has resulted in the ongoing reassessment of best practices to prevent their transmission. However, whether pathogen reservoirs exist in emergency medical services (EMS) vehicles remains largely unknown. We characterized the microbiome of EMS vehicles using Nanopore next generation sequencing of isolated DNA samples. Based on the pathogens identified during sequencing, we developed a bacterial two hybrid selection system to generate custom single-domain antibodies (Nanobodies?) that recognize important pathogens. Selected antibodies were then used to create a rapid, low-cost and on site ELISA-based testing kit. Our project provides a framework for the detection of emergent pathogens and a practical solution for monitoring their presence within and outside of the healthcare system.

","In April 2014, the World Health Organization released a report about the increasing danger of antibiotic resistance stating “A post-antibiotic era – in which common infections and minor injuries can kill ... is a very real possibility for the 21st century.” People continue to misuse antibiotics by not finishing their prescription, using them to combat inappropriate pathogens like viruses, and using them liberally in agriculture. When this happens, antibiotics can enter the water table. This selective pressure causes organisms in the water to adapt and become resistant to the antibiotics. Reducing the amount of antibiotics in the water supply will help to reduce this selective pressure. To remediate antibiotics in the environment we plan to generate a strain of E. coli that will export an enzyme known as Beta-lactamase to degrade Beta-lactam antibiotics. Ultimately, this will help reduce the selective pressure causing the evolution for antibiotic resistance.

The Camelid antibody IgG (cIgG), however, has lower complexity than the Human IgG. We present a new approach for recognition of food allergens with a synthetizised cIgG for expression in E. Coli. The epitope of cIgG is designed for Hen Egg White Lysosyme (HEWL). The cIgG is designed with a linker that connects to the bioluminescent enzyme Luciferase. We also synthetizised an HEWL antigen carrying the protein RFP, A-HRFP, that reacts to the luminescence of luciferase as the A-HRFP attaches to the cIgG.  

The recognition of HEWL in a sample leads to the release of luminescent green-light as a result of HEWL binding to the cIgG. If, however, no HEWL antigen is present in the sample, A-HRFP binds to cIgG resulting in a luminescent red-shift.

The constructed protein consists of epitope 2 from Arah1 and RFP. Arah1 has higher affinity than epitope 2 towards the binding site. Therefore, the constructed protein will be replaced and leave the antibody, if Arah1 has contaminated the food sample. We can measure if the constructed protein is attached by using FRET, a mechanism utilized to determine if two different fluorofores are at a close distance, in our case FITC and RFP.

Previous research has attempted to modify algae to promote the lipid synthesis thereby optimizing them for biofuel production. In this project we want to create new Biobricks consisting of inducible promoters to couple with a CRISPR/Cas9-system in C. reinhardtii. The reason for the inducible promoters is to avoid complications such as toxicity of a constitutively active Cas9.

","Increasing bacterial resistance to classical antibiotics remains a serious threat and urges the development of novel pathogen-killing strategies. Exploiting bacterial communication mechanisms such as quorum sensing is a promising strategy to specifically target certain pathogens. The major aim of this project is the introduction of a genetic circuit enabling Bacillus subtilis to actively detect, attach to, and eventually kill Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initially, we will introduce the autoinducer-sensing two-component systems of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae into B. subtilis to create a pathogen-detecting strain. By utilizing quorum sensing-dependent promoters, we will then trigger pathogen-killing strategies like the production of antimicrobial peptides or biofilm degradation. As a safety measure a delayed suicide-switch guarantees non-persistence of genetically modified B. subtilis in the absence of pathogens.

","Living in an aging society and facing the increasing organ shortage, we have developed a game-changing approach to bioprint tissues for biomedical application. Our interdisciplinary work entails creating a novel bioink that exploits the rapid and specific interaction of biotin and its tetrameric binding protein streptavidin. By employing this affinity, we have engineered cells presenting biotin moieties or biotin binding proteins on their surfaces and recombinant biotinylated proteins as spacer molecules, which both co-polymerize upon contact with streptavidin. Furthermore, we have explored different cellular circuits, which allow us to control pancreatic cell lines, induce tissue vascularization, or install biosafety mechanisms for printed tissues. To deliver these cells, we employ a hijacked 3D printer that enables us to manufacture three-dimensional multi-cellular structures in a user-definable manner.
Altogether, we are confident that our system provides the necessary means to advance the SynBio community to the next level – the tissue level.

","In 2010 it was estimated that 6.5 million people in the United States suffered from chronic wounds, accruing an annual cost of approximately $2.5 billion. Furthermore, experts predict that the burden of chronic wounds will increase rapidly in the near future. Chronic wounds are unable to heal in an orderly set of stages or within a time period of about three months. The etiology of chronic wounds is very diverse, but patients frequently suffer from persisting chronic wounds due to their bodies overproducing wound site proteases. In turn, these proteases decrease wound healing rates by degrading host growth factors and the extracellular matrix of the wound site. Our team is using a bioreactor and synthetic biology principles to purify and infuse platelet derived growth factor and a protease inhibitor into a synthetic collagen scaffold.

When coupled with heme oxygenase, these bacteriophytochromes are supplied with biliverdin, a pigment which allows for the self-assembly of a switch within the host system.

","iGEM Manchester-Graz’s aim is to take the first steps in the development of a novel technology for drug delivery by developing self-regulating, drug-producing bacteria. In the future, they could be incorporated into patients’ gut microflora to secrete medicines directly inside the body. We focused on the treatment of early stages of Parkinson’s disease, for which the current treatment involves oral administration of L-DOPA. To control the bacterial L-DOPA production in the gut, we plan to develop a multidimensional, cell density-dependent auto-regulation system that could also be used to control other multistep enzyme pathways. Since Manchester-Graz is an inter-European Team, the Manchester sub-team is working on L-DOPA biosynthesis in E. coli BL21(DE3) and Nissle 1917, while the Graz sub-team is developing the regulation system in the aforementioned strains. The project will be combined in a way that the regulation system would control the rate of biosynthesis for the accurate dosage.

","The use of proteins in medical treatment and diagnosis is steadily increasing.

Furthermore, these proteins need to be highly pure because of their use in diagnostics and treatment. Therefore, a major challenge is the development of systems that produce pure, posttranslational modified proteins - best at low costs.
 
Recently, the sunlight-driven microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum has been established as an elegant tool for the production of proteins. A major - however yet unchallenged - advantage of this system is the production of advanced proteins with specific posttranslational modifications and the ability of their direct secretion into the medium allowing easy purification with low effort and costs. Our mission is to challenge Phaectory for the convenient production of antibodies and make the system accessible to following iGEM teams.

In 'Syndustry', we follow nature’s own design principles by combining the strengths of individual microorganisms for the production of valuable biochemicals. We introduce a novel ‘plug-and-play’ production platform based on artificial endosymbiosis. This system goes beyond co-culturing microbes and overcomes current production limitations in fermentation.

","The vertebrate immune system produces billions of different antibodies. This diversity is generated by random VDJ-recombination of a limited number of antibody subfragments. This inspired us to construct an automatic recombination system in E. coli that generates large numbers of novel proteins by combinatorial fusion of functional domains.

The site-specific DNA recombinase Gin of bacteriophage Mu depends on the presence of a DNA enhancer element for efficient recombination. This allowed us to construct a system, called “The Recombinator”, which automatically shuts down after successful recombination. We visualized the randomizing function of our genetically engineered slot machine by combining colors with cellular localization domains.

By scaling up the number of recombination modules and functional domains our system will be able to generate a multitude of new proteins. We envision that “The Recombinator” will serve as a tool to create novel enzymatic activities for innovative drug design, environmental detoxification and metabolic engineering.

This is known as an activation-inhibition system.  We began by using a partial differential equation model of the system to explore the effect of varying the separation distance of the two populations of cells.  We found that three types of dynamics were present: steady states, periodic oscillations, and quasi-periodic oscillations.

","The usage of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) like plastic bottles is one of the biggest problem of our era. Many plastic bottles are not reusable. Some tougher, reusable plastic bottles may cause cancer. The main disadvantage of plastic bottles is that so many of them end up in landfills instead of being recycled. It takes hundreds of years for plastic bottles to biodegrade, and the degrading process emits toxic chemicals into the air.
We may alter the destiny of plastic in useful way.
Our project aims to keep the environment clean with the degradation of PET to pyruvate by E. coli. With this project, while the environment will be cleaned from PET, the E. coli would add pyruvate to the cell cycle and use it as a new energy source for itself.
We will biodegrade PET to Catechol. Then catechol to 2-hydroxymuconate resulting in pyruvate.

","People with celiac disease have to consume gluten free food because gluten creates an auto-immune response in their body. However, gluten free food is a lot more expensive than normal food. That is why, we decided to find a solution to this problem by taking kumamolisin and putting it in a vector of yeast that has alpha secretion factor then putting the plasmid in yeast. The yeast will produce and secrete kumamolisin enzyme to its external environment and will destroys gluten  while the bread continues to be fermented. We also prepared a gluten detection kit using green fluroscent protein in PQLP aminoacid sequence. If kumamolisin cuts the gluten it will have cut GFP as well so there will be no colour but if it does not cut the gluten than it also has not cut GFP so green color will be observed.

We also used Software Requirements Specification, Software Design Description and Quality Plan approaches to define requirements for each part and building blocks, risks and design art elements of the designed software program. Next, we have used graph theoretic modeling to visualize relations between parts and to standardize representation of the parts as much as possible. It will help us while trying to find input-output relations between either biobrick parts or constructs. By this way, our program as a Biobrick Guide will provide alternative pathway choices to users for construction of the most reliable devices with respect to given inputs and expected outputs.

","In the past year, paper-based transcription and translation, reconstituted from freeze-drying, have been adapted in a variety of ways and shown to be effective after a year of storage at room temperature.  However, currently, this technology is severely limited in its applications because protein detection requires a different strategy for each individual protein.  Aptapaper uses the targeting specificity of aptamers to create a modular protein detection system that can easily be adapted to any protein.  A DNA aptamer is bound to a DNA trigger and becomes unbound in response to its protein of specificity. This frees the DNA trigger to turn on an RNA toehold switch, resulting in a 40 fold change in reporter protein expression, with more results to come.  This system, when freeze-dried on paper, is cheap and portable, making it well suited to tackle the unmet needs for disease detection in remote areas.

Device employment could rigorously change the practices used in mercury decontamination efforts by switching to biological rather than chemical processes. Furthermore, this technology can be applied towards bioremediation and biosensing of various heavy metals and organic toxins in the environment.

","Both technical and social obstacles hinder widespread use of synthetic biology approaches. One technical challenge is optimization of multi-enzyme pathway gene expression. Viral 2A sequences can improve translational efficiency of polycistronic encoded proteins.  Here we demonstrated the utility of this technology in yeast by expressing genes to produce compounds in the beta carotenoid pathway. Furthermore, we have developed a mathematical model to estimate gene order for optimal biosynthetic production using 2A sequence and present it as a community tool to streamline future applications. Finally, accurate and widespread public knowledge regarding the use of genetically modified organisms is vital for increasing social acceptance of synthetic biology. We have correlated word usage to opinions regarding biotechnology to inform future efforts to engage the public.

","Gene drives induce biased inheritance of specific genes and are currently being considered as a method to regulate mosquito populations. However, the ability of gene drives to spread quickly through entire populations raises serious ethical concerns, especially when the genetic change affects reproduction. To address this issue, we constructed both a gene drive and an inducible recovery drive and modeled the combined system using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our gene drive results in deletion of both copies of the ADE2 gene from S. cerevisiae using the CRISPR/Cas system, causing the yeast to turn red. As a safety mechanism, we constructed a tetracycline-inducible recovery drive to counteract the function of our gene drive. The recovery drive restores the ADE2 gene allowing S. cerevisiae to return to its original color. Our gene/recovery drive system advances foundational work towards controlling global pests and invasive species, protecting information stored in DNA, and various other important applications.

","The growing need for alternative fuel sources has sparked interest and research across many scientific and engineering disciplines. The fledgling field of microbial fuel cell development has previously relied on anaerobic metal reducing organisms such as Geobacter sulfurreduccens. This project sought to isolate genes from the electron shuttling pathway in Geobacter and transform them into the more manageable aerobic Escherichia coli. The Missouri University of Science and Technology iGEM team isolated four outer membrane cytochrome (omc) genes from Geobacter, vital to the extracellular transportation of electrons. The four genes; omcB, omcE, omcS and omcT, were cloned into individual plasmids. The eventual goal is to combine all four genes into one plasmid to transform into E. coli to create an aerobic, electron transporting microbial system.

","""In the bodies of people with diabetes, the ability to recognize and respond to glucose concentrations in the blood has been compromised. As a result, glucose accumulates to dangerous levels. High blood glucose concentrations can cause irreversible damage to critical organs, impairing their functionality. With parts from the iGEM registry, our team created a glucose-controlled promoter linked to a yellow fluorescence production gene in E. coli. The concentrations of glucose to which the promoter responds can be determined. Once the concentration is known, the promoter can be mutated so that it will be activated by varying concentrations of glucose and be used as a glucose sensor for people with diabetes. In the future, an insulin gene could be added to this system for use in insulin pumps, where specific glucose levels trigger insulin production in E. coli.""

","There are a plethora of enzymes that occur in the natural world which perform reactions that could be immensely useful to humans. Unfortunately, the efficiency of some of these reactions may render their applications logistically unrealistic. The cellulosome scaffolding protein produced by Clostridium thermocellum has been shown to significantly increase the efficiency of cellulose degradation. The scaffolding protein can be reduced in size and adapted for the cell surface of Escherichia coli. Different cohesion sites on the new cell surface display protein can also be introduced to allow for attachment of desired enzymes. Future applications would include producing a collection of distinct versions of the scaffolding protein for unique arrangements and concentrations of enzymes, enabling construction of an extra-cellular assembly line for a variety of multi-enzymatic reactions. This would lay the foundation for making previously infeasible applications of reactions possible through increased efficiency.

Coal is one of the primary sources of global energy and produces carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollutants, among others, which contribute to global warming and acid rain formation. Fixing nitrogen through Cyanothece has another benefit besides reducing pollution; the end products are ammonia compounds which are a major component of fertilizer. We hope this will allow power companies to offset some of the costs of cleaning their emissions by selling the ammonia products to be made into fertilizer. We will be isolating the nitrogen fixing genes and adding them to the BioBricks Parts Registry for the Jamboree.

Affected hibernacula often face mortality rates in excess of 80%, an unsustainable loss in animals which only have one offspring per year. As it spreads, the disease impacts many bat species with roles in pest control and pollination.

Anti-fungal agents are typically indiscriminate, affecting native species which may be beneficial to the bat, while creating a strong selective pressure for future resistance. We have instead decided to develop a system using compounds which slow and inhibit the fungus, giving bats a better fighting chance.

We are modifying E. coli to produce ocimene, a terpene compound in orange fragrance, which has been shown to have inhibitory effects against fungi. We plan to explore enzyme inhibitors and fungal sensing for next year's competition.

","There has been growing interest in designing fast and reversible switchable controls over all steps of gene expression, from transcription to post-translational modification. Our project involves engineering S. cerevisiae to localize proteins to various points in the cell in response to light exposure. Under red light, a tagged protein of interest localizes to a specific target, while exposure to far-red light causes the protein to rapidly delocalize and diffuse throughout the cell. This is accomplished using the PhyB-PIF3 system, a light-based transcriptional regulation system found in Arabidopsis.  This project has two components. 1) Metabolically engineering yeast to endogenously produce PCB, a tetrapyrrole necessary for system activation, and 2) adapting the PhyB-PIF3 system to localize proteins of interest to different targets in the cell.  The versatility and applications for this system are vast, ranging from cellular diffusion studies to easily synchronizing cell division for entire populations.

Our bacterial system uses a toggle that takes advantage of quorum sensing and cell response to UV light and triggers the production of fluorescent proteins, and a polymer composed of a matrix of cross-linked phage. Our systems are remarkable because they translate a macroscale input into a pattern that emerges from the growth and re-modeling of cells.

","""Current medical practices are only able to scratch the surface of tissue engineering or organ development. Fortunately, nature has provided us with robust, cellular systems capable of governing the autonomous formation of complex structures. To pursue control of multicellular systems, we engineered a number of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms: the Notch-Delta juxtacrine signaling pathway and an assortment of G-Protein Coupled Receptors. Both signaling systems were modified to activate orthogonal genetic circuits, allowing for processing and integration of numerous signals. In order to facilitate and maintain pattern formation, we introduced cadherin, a natural intercellular glue. To understand and predict multicellular behavior, we developed a simulation framework based on the Synthetic Biology Open Language and CompuCell 3D modeling environment. Our models motivated several circuit designs we subsequently tested in the laboratory. Altogether, our developments establish a paradigm for manipulation of intercellular communication systems to drive self-organization of tissues.""

","The complexity of engineered genetic circuits in eukaryotic systems is limited by the availability of regulatory components and further hampered by the inability to assemble and deliver large DNA constructs.  In contrast, in vitro synthetic DNA circuits utilizing strand displacement have demonstrated complex digital logic with reliable and scalable behaviors in a small base-pair footprint. The possible adaption of such circuits into cellular environments can amplify the scale and complexity of biological circuits, broadening synthetic biology’s application space.

Our project leverages strand displacement to create a process technology that supports multi-input sensing, sophisticated information processing, and precisely-regulated actuation in mammalian cells. We construct RNA strand displacement circuits that detect endogenous mRNA, perform digital logic computation, and output desired proteins through programmable RNA interference pathways.  

We envision in-vivo RNA strand displacement as a new foundation for scaling up complexity in engineered biological systems, with applications in biosynthesis, biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics.

","Coordinating behavior across cell populations to form synthetic tissues requires spacial communication between individual cells. While there has been some success engineering single signals, sending multiple signaling elements spanning spatial scales for multicellular coordination remains a significant hurdle. Here, we describe a method for mammalian cell-cell communication utilizing engineered exosomes containing miRNA or protein signals. First, we demonstrate selectively packaging signaling miRNAs (miR-451 and miR-503) and synthetic fusion proteins (GFP, Cas9, and Cre recombinase each individually fused to the oligomerizing membrane targeting domain Acyl-TyA) into exosomes within cells engineered with sender genetic circuits. Next, we demonstrate that these miRNA and protein signals can modulate gene expression within cells engineered with receiver genetic circuits. Finally, we present preliminary cell-cell signaling results on populations of cocultured sender and receiver cells. Our method may enable multiplexed communication among populations of various cell types and the creation of sophisticated synthetic tissues.

","Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the aggregation of beta-amyloid oligomers in the brain. These cause neuron death and disrupt the proper functioning of surviving neurons. Despite the severity of the disease, Alzheimer's diagnosis and treatment are limited to post-symptomatic psychological methods and so there is great need for molecular detection and alleviation mechanisms. 

To address this, we have genetically engineered a system to diagnose and treat Alzheimer’s disease. Diagnosis is based on the detection of two Alzheimer’s-specific biomarkers in the brain: extracellular beta-amyloid protein oligomers and the intracellular miRNA profile of afflicted neurons. Successful detection triggers a treatment module that reduces beta-amyloid levels, thereby preventing neuronal death and slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s symptoms.

This research demonstrates an approach that could inform an eventual treatment, not only for Alzheimer’s disease, but for numerous other human afflictions.

","Relative to commonly used monocultures, microbial co-cultures can better handle consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) - the conversion of substrates to products in a single reactor - by dividing the metabolic load among multiple species. However, problems regarding stability and efficiency must be overcome to implement co-cultures for CBP on an industrial scale. We aim to produce a robust co-culture by ensuring stable, efficient ratios of bacteria using synthetic intercellular communication. Our co-culture converts agricultural waste, lignocellulose, into a useful product, biodiesel. It consists of Cytophaga hutchinsonii, a cellulolytic bacterium, and Escherichia coli, which is engineered to produce biodiesel. We introduce the LuxI/LuxR/AHL quorum sensing system as the communication pathway between the bacteria. To predict bacterial interactions and design the communication network, we model the dynamics of our co-culture using whole-genome scale metabolic models with dynamic flux balance analysis.

","Affecting approximately 1 in 10 women, endometriosis is a disease caused by cells similar to the endometrium of the uterus growing elsewhere in the body. These growths, called endometrial lesions, cause severe chronic pain and infertility. Because the only definitive diagnostic method is laparoscopic surgery, patients wait on average seven years between the onset of symptoms and an accurate diagnosis. 

The goal of the MIT iGEM team’s project is to expedite this diagnosis process with a genetic circuit that can sense the unique biomarkers of endometriosis. Our circuit identifies whether cells are diseased by checking the cells’ miRNA profiles and by sensing progesterone resistance, a hallmark of endometriosis. This identification process can be implemented in endometrial biopsy samples, eliminating the need for surgical diagnosis. Our approach could lead to a less invasive diagnostic method, enabling earlier treatment and improving patient outcomes.

","The Monash University iGEM team has identified that ethylene, a common organic compound, is under increasing production demands by the plastics and food industries. Current methods of production are energy intensive, and rely on processing of non-renewable fossil fuels. However many plants produce ethylene from L-methionine by use of the Yang cycle, which has lower energy requirements. We aim to introduce the genes that are required for ethylene production into Escherichia coli under the control of an inducible promoter, in an attempt to develop a cleaner and non-energy intensive method of production. At lower yields, this device may also provide a useful module for signal transduction between the E. coli and plants.

","Acne vulgaris affects around 85% of American adolescents. The four main causes of acne are comedogenesis, sebum production, proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, and inflammation in the form of papules, pustules, and nodules. Triglycerides, wax esters, squalene, free fatty acids, and sapienic acid are the main components of sebum.  Our team has created a biosystem that reduces the presence of sebaceous components (primarily wax esters). 

Our mechanism includes two proteins of interest-Medium Chain Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Medium Chain Aldehyde Dehydrogenase in two identical biological circuits to change the structure of wax esters and other lipids, rendering them insufficient for bacterial consumption. We included a basic promoter, RBS and terminator, making the protein-coding domain the only variable between the two circuits. We hope this mechanism facilitates sebum breakdown and reduces inflammatory responses of the P. acne bacteria.

","Our team goal was to advance the developing field of bacterial computing.  The Satisfiability (SAT) problem was the first mathematical problem proven to be NP-complete. A SAT problem is formed by connecting true-false variables with OR to form clauses and connecting clauses with AND.  The goal is to determine if true-false values can be assigned to each variable to make the overall logical expression true. Our designed system uses frameshift suppressor tRNAs as inputs and frameshift suppressor leaders (FSLs) that process the inputs to enable the translation of fluorescent proteins exactly when an appropriate combination of inputs is present.

","Eucalyptol, the main component of Eucalyptus oil, is a valuable product with multiple potential industrial uses. Current methods are costly, which is a major deterrent for research on these applications. We have designed a system consisting of three strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) which will convert spent grain waste from breweries into Eucalyptol. The design utilizes two strains of E. coli overexpressing and secreting enzymes to degrade hemicellulose into xylose. The third strain of E. coli will utilize the xylose and convert the molecule into Eucalyptol using the Mevalonate pathway. A scale-up model was developed to assess industrial feasibility. The cost of production would drop two-thirds, which would make industrial uses plausible. Future studies will be transforming our E. coli with the genes of interest and testing for production of Eucalyptol.

","Currently, the biotechnologically relevant model strain of cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, lacks resilience to cold temperature perturbations. If large-scale operations for photosynthetic production of industrial compounds are to be realized, robustness to unpredictable weather conditions must be considered. Two complementary approaches are being proposed to increase cold adaptation and resistance to freezing in S. elongatus. Previously, it was shown the expression of lipid desaturase desA increases the cold-growth tolerance of S. elongatus. We now aim to improve this range by fine-tuning the expression of a riboswitch-controlled desA. We also hypothesize that introduction of SFR2 from Arabidopsis thaliana—responsible for remodeling the outer chloroplast membrane for increased freezing tolerance—will increase cellular viability to freezing events. Through this two-pronged approach, we aspire to engineer a cyanobacterial strain that ultimately could be used for the production of industrially-relevant products in unreliable environment conditions.

","Global problems concerning heavy metals, including metal contamination and metal recovery, have become increasingly significant in the aquatic environment. Among numerous heavy metals, such as toxic metals, noble metals and radioactive metals which can be viewed as potential resources, we focus on lead, gold and uranium. Here by using Bacillus subtilis as a bioreactor, we are working to devise a way to absorb and retrieve heavy metals. A “Metallosniper” targeted at lead, gold and uranium has been successfully engineered. With the feature of producing endospores, we have made it possible for B. subtilis to absorb heavy metals under both benign conditions and adverse circumstances. In a gesture to further improve the efficiency of binding metals, biofilm, cell surface-display system and degradable materials for immobilization are applied in our project.

Presence of these ions drives the transcription of specific fluorescent proteins. Detection of these proteins is enabled through a light detection apparatus and the information can be sent to mobile devices in a user-friendly interface via a modified Google ADK. This novel multibiosensor can be implemented to detect pollutants in sewer systems, septic tanks, and other sources of water, and provide an early-detection warning system, preventing the pollutants from causing serious harm to equipment, animals, or people.

While rice can be fortified using vitamin powders, such approaches have had limited success because many vitamins are leeched away during the washing process prior to cooking. To address this problem, we have engineered proteins that will adhere nutrients to rice grains and prevent losses. These proteins contain a starch-binding domain that is fused to specific nutrient-binding domains. Because rice is composed mainly of starch, the starch-binding domain prevents nutrient leeching during washing. Upon cooking, the nutrient-binding domain denatures and releases the nutrients into the cooked rice. Supplementing rice with these fusion proteins will provide a novel, non-GMO approach to fortifying rice. Proteins with a starch-binding domain connected to a vitamin B12-binding domain, a thiamine-binding domain, a lysine-rich protein, and a RFP have been created.

Eventually, we expect to see a specific accumulation of the siRNA in the mice’s tumor tissues and the decreased expression of the oncogenes at the transcription level.

","Fatty acid(FFA) plays an essential role in many aspects of modern society, such as food industry, rubber industry, fuel, etc. Relied on animal grease or plant oil currently, the FFA production, however, is highly restricted by seasonal, regional factors and the expensive manufacturing cost. Therefore, we strive to transform E.coli into a biological factory that produces more FFAs of different length of carbon chain and saturation levels in both an efficient and a controlled manner. 
To achieve that, we will introduce FFA desaturase and various thioesterase, key enzymes for unsaturated FFA production and FFA synthesis respectively, and different operon structure into the engineering E.coli. Also, we design a fluorescence system composed of Transcriptional Regulatory Protein FadR to monitor the FFA producing status in E.coli. In this case, we can produce different FFAs by applying different signals to operons in E.coli and detect the real time production status by fluorescence report.

Microvesicles (MVs) are lipid-bilayer vesicles which are naturally secreted by almost all cell types, playing crucial roles in intercellular transport of bioactive molecules. Given the intrinsic ability to naturally transport functional RNAs between cells, MVs potentially represent a novel and exciting drug carrier. In our project we are trying to express both anti-virus siRNA within the cell and target protein on the surface of the MVs by engineering the HEK 293T cell, which is capable of producing large amounts of MVs. Thus, the MVs produced by our engineered HEK 293T cells will contain the siRNA and be able to specifically deliver the siRNA to the sites we want, acting as biomissile for the targeted destruction of the disease.

The functionality of this flexible dual promoter was determined in both mammalian and bacterial chassis.

As cancer cells grow faster than healthy cells, they also consume more oxygen and release more lactate than a healthy cell would do, so to make the E.coli cells recognize cancer cells we have made a system where the input signals are high lactate concentration and low oxygen concentration. When these criteria are met, the E.coli cells will undergo lysis, and release the toxin colicin, which our cells are producing constitutively.
With our project, we want to show that one of the biggest challenges in medicine can be solved by synthetic biology.

","The changes observed in the global climate within the last hundred years have been attributed to rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). This heavy increase in atmospheric CO2 is thought to be caused by the heavy industrialisation of our civilisation with the use of fossil fuels. With the potential impact climate change could have for many ecosystems globally, it becomes apparent we need to slow-down, if not prevent these changes in order to preserve our current habitat. One strategy for reducing the CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is biological carbon fixation. The project undertaken will look at establishing the lactate inducible expression system into Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Once established, glucose oxidase (GOx) will be incorporated into this expression system. It is proposed that Glucose oxidase will prevent respiration of the organism, thereby increasing its carbon fixation capacity.

To achieve this, the promoters of operons commonly found in P. putida are used. These are negatively controlled; the release of the repressor and thus the expression of subsequent genes is initiated by derivatives of glucose.

Further, the engineered bacteria are encapsulated in alginate, a polysaccharide from brown algae. The capsule properties are tailored to best suit our engineered cells and possible applications.

","Implementing logic gates in living cells poses an interesting challenge in synthetic biology. Logic gates are the building blocks of digital electrical circuits, allowing rational, modular design of complex functions. Successful implementations of equivalent systems in living cells would open up new possibilities for regulation and manipulation of cell metabolism.

This project will implement a biological XOR gate by exploiting a naturally occurring type of DNA called DNA ribozymes. These single stranded DNA sequences are able to bind to and cut sequence specific RNA sequences, almost like restriction enzymes for RNA. Combining DNA ribozymes with silencing of reporter gene expression will allow us to design a system which responds to inducer signals in an XOR-gate like fashion inside living cells.

The XOR gate is perhaps the most challenging logic gate to recreate biologically, and a successful proof of concept would pave the way for similar implementations of other logic gates.

Firstly, despite the variety of Cas9/Cpf1 protein discovered, we still do not know the efficiency of each protein when compared to each other. Furthermore, the cutting efficiency for different cut sites varies. The populaity of this technology come from it's ability to enhance the rate of knock-ins.

","Biomolecule delivery systems are often plagued by problems such as non-specific targeting and low bioavailability. Engineered systems that have the ability to sense and respond to specific stimuli present in the microenvironment of pathogenic cells are able to overcome these issues. 
We propose to engineer a dual-sensor bacterium that can sense increased metabolite levels in its microenvironment and then respond by delivering biomolecules into target cells. As a proof-of-concept, Escherichia coli was engineered to detect increased level of lactate, then respond by attaching itself to a cancer cell marker, and subsequently release biomolecules into the cell. A kill switch will be activated when there is insufficient lactate present, thus minimising non-specific targeting. In addition, our delivery system also has the flexibility to detect other environmental metabolites, together with the ability to engineer the bacterium to bind to other cell receptors for their detection and thus deliver biomolecules.

","Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant tumor with 640,000 new cases annually worldwide. Saliva testing is non-invasive procedure that allows detecting OSCC biomarkers. Elevated level of p53 protein was identified in OSCC patients at different stages of the disease. Camelid antibodies containing only variable regions, nanobodies (VHH) and single-chain variable regions (scFv) with VH and VL, are becoming popular in research and diagnostics. It was identified that VL region showed higher affinity for p53 than VHH, and dimerization of VL regions increases their affinity up to ten folds.  Camelid antibodies can be conjugated to other proteins without loss of function. They can be expressed and secreted in such common model organism as E. coli, reducing the cost of antibody production. Therefore, the aim of this project is to design biosensor to detect p53 in saliva samples for OSCC diagnosis using nanobodies expressed in bacteria.

","Streptococcus mutans is the most widely accepted cause of dental caries. ComX stimulates the transcription of the genes essential for competence.  However, there is a chance to reduce ComX level by overexpressing its novel antagonist,  XrpA. The highly expressed level of XrpA protein leads to decreased biofilm formation. Our project aims two goals.  The first one is to overexpress the production of XrpA in order to cease the production of ComX protein. The second one will implement CRISPR-dCas9 system in order to block the transcription of VicK gene. VicK is the gene of VicK/VicR signal transduction system in S.mutans that is responsible for acidity tolerance in bacteria. Thus, second system will combine sgRNA for VicK and dCas9 to reduce lactic acid production. Smart systems will be eliminated by blue light safety regulation system that targets origin of replication of the plasmid constructs.

We call this microbial device “Blue leaf”. The device consists of three parts, first we use electrical energy to convert carbon dioxide to formaldehyde, then use benzoylformate decarboxylase to catalyze formaldehyde into two and three-carbon intermediates, finally use fructose 6-phosphate aldolase to condense two and three-carbon units to form the five-carbon molecule-xylose.

This year, the NYMU-Taipei iGEM team creates a systematic disease control method that can prevent, detect, and cure potato late blight. Inspired by competitive inhibition in pharmacology, we designed a ligand with higher affinity to block the entrance of P. infestans effector proteins. To detect infection in the plant, we devised a soil-based microbial fuel cell (SMFC) detecting salicylic acid emission and producing oscillating current.

Keratin waste is typically disposed of through incineration, burying the waste, or mechanical processing that yields low-quality protein products.  All these processes take their toll on the environment.  However, Keratinase is a serine protease that primarily attacks the disulfide bonds in keratin waste—such as feathers and hair.  Thus, the expression of bacterial keratinases provides an opportunity to manage this degradation-resistant keratin waste and turn it into a high quality protein product such as fertilizer or animal feed.
 	To do this, two Keratinase Genes isolated from the Bacillus genera are used.  Keratinase A (kerA) is more active in degrading keratin in feathers, while Keratinase US (kerUS) is most effective in degrading the keratin in hair.

","Membranous organelles are unique structures of eukaryotic cells, rare bacteria and paleontology. Magnetospirillum magneticum is an important biological model system of prokaryotic organelle study because the structure of magnetosome in Magnetospirillum magneticum has similar traits to eukaryotic organelles with membranes. Our task is to reconstruct the magnetosome membrane in Escherichia coli.
   Magnetospirillum magneticum requires a micro-aerobic and oligotrophic environment in order to produce magnetosome, so the significance of our project lies in simplifying the magnetosome produce method, opening up the path for futher functional gene research. We use homologous recombination to transfer the mamAB gene into E.coli to build an IMS part.
   Also, as the mamK gene is crucial to the IMS construction. We want to improve the mamK gene's expression by stabilizing its mRNA with a new method, hoping it can be used to promote the IMS construction. So we design a DNA segment to slow down mRNA degradation.

We transport the plasmid with double plasmids system into the organism, and then the constructed plasmid that has lysis device can transfer to the dominant colony in organism by conjugation. Afterwards, the dominant colony with constructed plasmid can lysis and release the constructed plasmid and a fusion protein composed of cationic TAT peptide and histone H4 that we has designed.

","Generally, stem-loops forming polynucleotides are more stable than the single-stranded ones. Particularly, mRNA with a stem-loop at its 3'- or 5'-end often has a longer half-life than their linear counterpart owing to the stem loops' resistance to exoribonucleases. Our team designed a polycistron gene expression construct, in which each gene followed by a stem-loop and an endoribonuclease cleavage site. When it is transcribed, digested by the endoribonuclease, and cleaved into independent mRNAs with different stem-loops, different mRNA shows different stability, determined by the designed Gibbs free energy (?G) of their stem-loops, resulting in different expression level of their encoded proteins. In this way, we decouple the gene expression level of the same operon simply by designing different stem-loops. In addition, by quantitatively adjusting the free energy of the stem-loops, we can even achieve a stoichiometry expression of the target proteins precisely, like playing a beautiful concerto of cistrons.

In addition to C. acetobutylicum’s native pathways, the introduction of non-native genes makes it possible to expand the types of alcohols produced. The goal of this research endeavor was to develop an iGEM compliant Clostridial shuttle vector to introduce genes for the production of branched and longer chain alcohols within Clostridial species.

","Sending a message across the ocean… Outer membrane vesicles (OMV), naturally produced by gram negative bacteria as E. Coli, are strong candidates for long-distance messaging. Our engineered communication platform consists of controlling OMV production by destabilizing membrane integrity through over-expression of specific periplasmic proteins (e.g., TolR). In order to control and modulate message content, we used fusions with OmpA signal sequence and the ClyA hemolysin as delivery tags. A targeting system was developed, based on the outer-membrane expression of Jun/Fos leucine zippers to control the vesicle flux between donor and recipient cells. Once received, the signal from incoming vesicles is transduced through a modified Fec pathway, whereby the receptor is provided by the OMV. Computational models provided insight to all of the above steps. Such reliable communications systems have wide biotechnological implications, ranging from targeted drugs delivery and detoxification to advanced division of labor or even cell-based computing.

Strategies developed to address this problem provide varying levels of containment, however, the substantial elimination of HGT remains difficult or perhaps impossible.

We have developed a new containment system to expand the range of environments where GEOs can be used safely. To do so, we rely on three levels of containment: physical containment with alginate capsules, semantic containment using an amber suppressor system, and an improved killswitch featuring delayed population-level suicide through complete genome degradation.

","Body odors are complex phenomena observed among mammalian species. Corynebacterium striatum and Bacillus subtilis are among the main contributors to body odors. One of the objectives of our project is identifying and isolating natural mutants that have non-functional odor-producing enzymes using CRISPRs. 
We're also engineering bacteria to degrade smelly molecules: TMA (trimethylamine) and 2-nonenal. The old people smell is mainly due to 2-nonenal. To degrade it, we want to perform directed evolution on skin bacteria. TMA has a fish odor and it appears in people suffering from trimethylaminuria. We will clone the enzyme trimethylamine monooxygenase, which degrades TMA, in E.coli and skin bacteria. Parallelly, we intend to develop a set of primordial odors by cloning enzymes known to catalyze reactions yielding volatile compounds. 
We're also focusing on scientific communication, for that, we are developing an online course developed on the Education Genius platform about iGEM high school.

","Food fermentation is practiced by every culture in the world, and is especially widespread throughout the Indian subcontinent. Although fermentation enriches foods with some essential vitamins and amino acids, many regions of the subcontinent still suffer from high malnutrition. We are addressing this problem by engineering S. cerevisiae and lactobacilli, commonly found in Indian fermented rice dishes, to enrich foods with vitamins A, B2, and B12, and bioavailable iron. 

We also implemented a differentiation system for reducing the fitness cost of over-expression of multiple pathways, and an easy E. coli sensor for measuring vitamin concentration using a riboswitch.

Our user-centered approach incorporates a low-cost and open hardware framework, both for growing and distributing starter cultures, and for quality control. This will give local affected populations power over their own food, as opposed to other GMO nutritional enrichment strategies, by allowing them to grow their own source of vitamins.

Our team is using synthetic biology to replace PERC with a biological alternative. To do so we are screening samples from all around the world to look for stain-digesting microbes, we are characterising candidate enzymes with putative stain digesting activity, and we are searching for fabric binding domains to enhance their stain fighting power! With some microbiology, synthetic biology, metabolic engineering and a lot of creativity we will find a green technology to make dry cleaners forget all about PERC.

","Counting is the action of finding the number of elements in a set.  Past attempts at developing counters in cells have mostly attempted to mimic the binary methods that computers use to count.Our first counter takes a new approach to counting in cells, essentially a mechanical rotary counter implemented on a micro scale.  Each time the counter detects an input, it performs an excision and integration directly down-stream of the active site, turning on a reporter and rotating over one 'notch' on the counter.Our second counter operates on the wholly different principle that the statistical occurrence of a rare event in a large population can be modeled.  Each cell in our population harbors a construct that when stimulated has a small chance of excising a terminator and expressing a resistance gene.  The number of resistant cells is thus an accurate count of the number of input stimuli.

","PCBs (Polychlorobiphenyls) are synthetic chemicals widely used during the late 20th century. These compounds are extraordinarily stable, not readily biodegradable and have accumulated in the environment. PCBs also accumulate in animal fatty tissues including human tissues. As PCBs are probably carcinogenic and some are endocrine disruptors, they constitute an important health issue. 
Although PCBs have no natural equivalents, some bacterial communities have developed the capacity to degrade PCBs. Highly chlorinated PCBs undergo anaerobic reductive dechlorination, lowering the chlorine atom number. Lightly chlorinated PCBs are then degraded via the aerobic biphenyl degradation pathway. 
Our project is to construct an Escherichia coli strain capable of degrading PCBs by introducing in the strain genes involved in PCB degradation in various bacteria. Because some steps are anaerobic and others aerobic, we want to use an oxygen-based regulation of gene expression. We also want to develop a sensor system to detect PCBs in the environment.

","Synthetic Biology has the power of changing paradigms of society such as our conception of what living beings are. 
If we deprive bacteria from their “unnecessary"" functions and have them produce what we need, do these bacteria still possess the status of living organisms or have they become machines? To raise this question, we adopted an artistic approach, as Bio-Art is one of the best way to spark debate with citizens. 
We create a concept organism that would reflect these interrogations. We modify Escherichia coli to produce the scent and simulate the ripening process of a lemon. A mixture of bacteria and growth medium will be molded: it will smell, ripe and look like a lemon, but ""ceci n’est pas un citron” - this is not a lemon… or is it?

","The iGEM competition is the birthplace to many innovative ideas aimed at improving processes in synthetic biology by working with Genetically Engineered Organisms (GEO). However, most projects involve a risk of GEOs dissemination outside the laboratory, which raises environmental issues. To prevent such a risk, we designed a biosafety system that would prevent or at least dramatically limit the chances of accidental GEO spreading. The system consists in both a physical confinement which still allows the GEO to carry out its main function, and a temperature-based containment which ensures the survival of the organism in a restricted temperature range. Escherichia coli was chosen to implement the temperature based system due to its wide use in the iGEM projects. Thus, our system dubbed SafetE.coli could provide the iGEM teams with a ""safer"" chassis which is less likely to contaminate the environment.

Our project aims at testing this hypothesis and determining if the expression of genes under the control of promoters of different strengths can be affected by their spatial proximity.
We thus designed a new adaptable tool composed of two different dCas9s fused with the FRB / FKBP12 dimerization system (induced by rapamycin) to increase the spatial proximity of two different DNA regions. We also designed a tool composed of two dCas9s and a tripartite split-GFP to visualize the spatial proximity of these two DNA regions. 
Altogether, these tools offer new perspectives for gene expression control and visualization of the spatial proximity of chromosomal regions.

As one of the major pollutants, plastic waste is a growing resource with 25 million tons produced in 2014 in Europe alone. Because of their composition, plastics have a very slow degradation rate and produce persistent organic pollutants. This leads to an increase of plastic pollution and an accumulation of plastic microparticules in our ecosystem, especially in the oceans.
PlastiCure is a biological system designed in E.coli to degrade polyethylene terephthalate and use the degradation products to synthesize a commonly used antibiotic: Erythromycin A. For this, exogenous DNA sequences are integrated in multiple operons to express the biodegradation pathway (22kb) and the biosynthesis pathway (55kb).

We used a nahR gene, on plasmid NAH7 (BBa_J61051), which breaks down naphthalene in a cell environment into the more inert catechol. We then use the downstream element BBa_K118021, whose protein product, catechol-2, 3-dioxygenase, catalyzes the conversion of catechol to 2-HMS (2-hydroxymuconate semialdyhyde) a yellow-colored molecule. In addition, we created a cell that will be able to broadly identify other toxic fracking byproducts via a nonspecific SOS cell damage element. The promoter recognizes and binds to a combination of sequences of SOS repressor proteins produced after cellular stress from damaging toxins or radiation. This promoter (BBa_K518010) will be attached to a downstream element (BBa_K592009) coding for a blue-colored protein, so that bacterial cells exhibiting stress can be easily discerned.

","During this summer, our group has developed a method to engineer bacteria into heavy metal decontamination kits. First of all, we analyzed the function, structure and operation of the transcription factor MerR, a mercury-responsive regulator in detail via bioware experiments and modeling. Then appropriate topology candidates for proper bioreporters were carefully searched. We selected a candidate and re-designed genetic components to accomplish certain bioreporter function in need, which was verified by following bioware experiments. For bioabsorbents, we engineered MerR into a metal binding peptide. This was followed by inductive expression of engineered peptide on surface, periplasm and cytosol of E.coli. This reverse engineering method was then expanded to lead-responsive regulator, PbrR, to confirm the validness of this method.

","Optogenetic tools have made significant impact on life sciences and beyond. However, several serious issues remain: cytotoxicy, narrow dynamic range, and dependency on laser and exogenous chromophore. To circumvent these, Peking iGEM has rationally constructed a hypersensitive sensor of luminance- Luminesensor. Primarily, the sensor was designed by fusing blue-light-sensing protein domain from Neurospora with DNA binding domain of LexA from E.coli, following which protein structure inspection and kinetic simulation were conducted to rationally perform optimization. Amazingly, Luminesensor was proved to be as sensitive as to sense natural light and even bioluminescence. With this sensor, spatiotemporal control of cellular behavior, such as phototaxis, high-resolution 2-D and 3-D bio-printing using dim light and even luminescence of iPad were shown to be very easy. What’s more, we successfully implemented cell-cell signaling using light, which is the very first time in synthetic biology and of great importance for biotechnological use.

","Aromatic pollution is becoming a worldwide concern, and monitoring aromatics remains challenging. Noting the abundant genomic data of prokaryotes from aromatics-rich environment, Peking iGEM applied part mining to the genetic repertoire to develop a comprehensive set of biosensors for aromatics. The transcriptional regulators for each typical class of aromatic compounds were bioinformatically determined and promoter engineering and protein engineering were performed to tune their function.

To expand the detection range, enzymes in upper pathways, working as plug-ins, were coupled with biosensors to degrade aromatics to detectable compounds. For environmental detection, we construct the band pass filter to detect a certain range of concentration. Responses of biosensors equipped with band-pass filter can robustly reflect the concentration of environmental samples. 

Peking iGEM has remarkably enriched the library of biosensors for aromatics and enabled quantitative detection for environmental monitoring. These biosensors will be also potent for metabolic engineering and well-characterized synthetic biological tools.

Hence Peking iGEM is dedicated to constructing engineered microorganisms for the elimination of algae and recovery of ecosystems. 

A specific antimicrobial peptide is secreted to disrupt the outer membrane of algae. In addition, we equip our transgenic cells with features that allow for buoyancy and attachment, making our project more efficient. During this process, an enzyme is also secreted to degrade a deleterious product of algae. After eradicating the algae, our engineered bacteria will commit suicide, and the ecosystem is finally restored.

This project is an innovative treatment for water bloom, and has potential applications in the field of ecosystem remediation.

","Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains one of the world's most serious public health problems. Although tuberculosis is curable and the treatment success rate is high, it is still the second most common cause of death from infectious disease. Most of the deaths occur for lack of effective identification of those in need of therapy. Case detection is currently the rate-limiting step in TB control. A diagnostic tool with high sensitivities and specificities is desired urgently, and it is supposed to be used at the point-of-care within a clinic or in the community. To obviate such problems, Peking iGEM is developing a novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection system that can transform biomarkers of TB into optical signal or electric signal. Combined with our work in software and hardware development, this new advanced system can be turned out as a powerful tool in TB diagnosis, with high sensitivities and specificities.

Nowadays, several common methods are adopted to cope with uranium pollution, such as solidification of poluted soil and phytoremediation. Nevertheless, these methods are flawed owing to high cost, lengthy procedures as well as potential secondary contamination.
To overcome the drawbacks of traditional methods, Peking iGEM team focus on constructing a novel multi-functional biological material which is able to absorb uranyl ion fleetly with high specificity and affinity. This uranyl-absorbing material can be synthesized and secreted continuously by bacteria, self-assembled in extracellular environment, and harvested in a cost-effective manner. It also has a great potential to be modified and expanded due to its modular design.

Using luminescent proteins and optogenetic tools, we constructed 'Sender' and 'Receiver' HEK 293T cells which send and receive blue light, respectively. The Sender Cell expresses a 480nm light emitting protein. The Receiver Cell expresses Channelrhodopsin-2, an ion channel gated by 480nm light. When the Receiver Cell is illuminated, Channelrhodopsin-2 opens, triggering a second luminescent protein via calcium influx. Since the luciferases in this system require an externally added luciferin substrate, we have also been developing Pre-coelenterazine, a genetically encoded luciferin which could allow our system to function autonomously.

The task of creating an oxygen bio-sensor is compounded by the fact that oxygen diffusion through many substances is very limited; so oxygen contamination can be undetected due to a response which is too 'soft' . To combat this, we enabled our sensor to induce this response in non-oxygenated bacteria via the lux system; thus amplifying the signal and producing a bio-alarm which is sufficiently 'loud' to not be missed.  To accomplish this goal we characterized the response characteristics of the many different Lux components in the parts-distribution.  This system can be easily inverted to monitor oxygen depletion in oxygen dependent processes.

","Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that not only affects those working around radiation facilities, but those dealing with the aftermath of widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor. Penn State's team project designed and constructed a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to create a robust and reliable biosensor that utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch as the radiation sensor. When the sensor detects radiation, it triggers one of three fast acting reporters we developed based on the concept developed by Imperial College's 2010 iGEM team. Each of the reporters features a different enzyme/substrate reaction (beta-galactosodise/beta-D-galactose, beta-glucurodinase/beta-D-glucuronide or C23O/catechol). We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters.

Variations in RBS translation initiation rates and length between start codons provide additional data. Repeating sequences of non-degenerative threonine and alanine codons measure codon bias and determine E. coli DH10B’s ability to translate varying lengths of identical codons through the use of mCherry and GFP reporters.

We demonstrate our approach on a 5-enzyme catabolic pathway that functions in P. putida, but not in E. coli. Once a multi-enzyme pathway functions in a preferred host, the DNA sequence of the system must then be optimized to achieve a desired metabolic activity. We took a forward engineering approach to systematically investigate the differences in translation rate capacity when using either ""frequent"", ""fast"", ""rare"", or ""slow"" synonymous codons during codon optimization of protein coding sequences. Our research will enable metabolic engineers to overcome two of the most commonly encountered combinatorial questions during metabolic pathway engineering.

Microviridins have a high potential for therapy as they can block disease-relevant proteases. Yet, the possibilities of cyclic peptides are largely untapped since genetic systems for optimization are not well established. Thus, we developed synthetic systems for the mutation, selection and production of such peptides.

MUFASA aims not only at facilitating the scarless cloning from the oligonucleotide design to putting the tubes into the thermocycler, but also at designing the fragments themselves in parallel with the overlaps for synthesis of big constructs de novo. Use of multiple overlaps pose a risk of non-specific hybridization and overlap “shadowing”. Such “shadowy places” may be eliminated by thermodynamic sequence optimization of both CPEC primers and fragments of the desired construct.

In Pumas Synbio, this problematic is addressed by the genetic modification of the seaweed Chlorella vulgaris, with the objective to optimize the lipid production and facilitate collecting them without needing to sacrifice the biomass.
The advantages are multiple, some examples might include that the production costs and time inversion is lower, the seaweeds can adapt and reproduce in any available space  and scale, which makes it an efficient and cheap option to normal fuels.

Specifically, CD133+ cells have shown resistance to hypoxia, irradiation, and some forms of chemotherapy. CD133+ hunting machines will be created by genetically engineering microglial cells (BV-2) with mammalian expression vectors. The project will also take advantage of inherent qualities of the microglia such as constant environmental sensing and quick motility.

","From water-logged soils to overpopulated regions of tumors, low-oxygen environments distress plant and mammalian systems.  Plants with inadequate levels of oxygen move from aerobic respiration to alcohol fermentation to sustain their metabolism.  This switch causes the accumulation of byproducts that are detrimental to the plant.  A synthetic biological circuit, centering on the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) promoter, has been developed indicating when low oxygen levels (< 5% O2) are present in plants.  Similarly, low oxygen zones can develop in solid tumors in numerous mammalian cancer models.  Substantial evidence indicates that hypoxia in tumors initiates angiogenesis, a process that aids in tumor proliferation.  Accordingly, an additional hypoxia-sensitive circuit that up-regulates the activity of a reporter protein in low oxygen (<1% O2) environments has been created for mammalian systems.  The development and characterization of these circuits will provide tools to explore the consequences and identity of hypoxic environments in mammalian and plant systems.

","With the majority of pharmaceuticals originating from biosynthetic products, the demand for understanding these compounds for their production in industry is increasing. Many of these natural products are produce by Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthatases (NRPSs), which are megaenzymes found in certain fungi and bacteria. These products are great lead compounds but often possess poor pharmacokinetics or high toxicity. NRPS can incorporate non-standard amino acids, and have the ability to append unique substituents onto their product. These factors make optimizing lead compounds extremely difficult through synthetic chemistry. Using nature as our guide along with the tools of synthetic biology we will be modifying NRPS at the DNA-level to improve the properties of lead compounds. We will be introducing tools to capture large NRPS gene clusters, append chemical modifications onto products, and screen NRPS production in a high throughput fashion. Synthesizing lead compounds will be as easy as “Pharming the Blues”.

","Easily manipulated genetics make the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae a versatile and widely used model eukaryote. To progress, researchers must often determine the mating type of haploid strains, which typically takes days. The goal of our project is to reduce that time to hours. So we designed a novel promoter harboring Ste12 and LexA binding sequences and placed it upstream of an ORF encoding a red fluorescent reporter fused to LexA binding and VP64 activator domains. Others have shown that this fusion protein induces its own expression from a LexA promoter. We propose that Ste12, activated in the pheromone response pathway, will bind the hybrid promoter and induce expression of the fusion protein, which will amplify and maintain its own expression. Therefore, when mating pheromone receptors on a haploid harboring this latch-type circuit are bound and activated, the cell will fluoresce and function as a rapid mating type detector.

We address this goal by constructing a unique platform for interspecies-dependence based on inducible expression of a required histidine biosynthetic gene (HIS) in each species. Expression of the bacterial HIS gene is induced by lactic acid produced by constitutive expression of a lactate dehydrogenase gene in the eukaryote. Expression of the yeast HIS gene is induced by the binding of its mating factor receptor to mating factor expressed constitutively on the surface of the prokaryote. Histidine deprivation necessitates physical contact and symbiosis for survival. Such pressure may facilitate evolution of a stable exosymbiotic form of the two species. Study of isolates and further manipulation could provide insight into the use of obligate symbiosis in synthetic biology and yield a chassis for the synthesis of novel multicellular machines.

","Astaxanthin is a naturally-occurring keto-carotenoid found in microalgae, salmon, shrimp, crustaceans, and the feathers of some birds. It provides the red color of salmon meat and cooked shellfish.Because astaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant with great value in medical and health care,it is meaningful to make astaxanthin an accessible health product.Currently, the industrial ways to produce astaxanthin are extract from microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis,Phaffia yeast,shrimp processing waste and chemical product.However these ways aren’t safety enough and the purification is difficult. While higher plants are supposed to be an efficient and safe bioreactor to produce astaxanthin,because it has advanced protein processing system to produce complex product.So we think about using higher plant to  produce astaxanthin.In our project,we take rice endosperm as the bioreactor of astaxanthin production,and use a technique called multiple-gene metabolic engineering to specifically express astaxanthin in rice endosperm. In this way, rice endosperm can produce and store astaxanthin.

","An active Tuberculosis infection causes various volatile organic compounds (VOC) to be produced. One VOC is 1-Methylnapthlene which can be broken down and used to activate the Naphthalene Regulator transcription factor (NahR) native to Pseudomonas putida. Using two mutants of NahR we can produce a sensitive switch with a positive feedback loop ensuring small traces of VOC found in the breath can be detected. Our device consists of four parts. The Degrader, an operon which breaks 1-Methylnapthelene into 3-Methlysalicylate. The Detector, which contains NahR and Psal, a promoter requiring NahR and 3-Methylsalicylate for activation. The Degrader and Detector work in conjunction to turn on the production of the next two parts. The Feedback loop codes for a mutant of NahR that can activate Psal alone. Lastly, the Reporter produces tyrptophanase which in the presence of enzymes from the Degrader will produce indigo, an insoluble dye compound.

For the heterologous expression of polyketide synthases(PKSs), the main method of the technology is transferring full gene cluster into heterologous host strains. However, such method can’t synthetize various polyketides by the same polyketide synthase domains. This year, we are dedicated to using PKS domains as a synthetic unit to diminish the size of the target gene fragments. Meanwhile, the host strain E. coli should be genetically modified in order to enable the synthesis of the corresponding substrate. In this way, PKS domains can be assembled more quickly, enabling the programmed polyketide synthesis. In addition, we can design synthesis pathway of polyketide independently. This system can select the corresponding synthesis polyketide synthase domains to synthetize polyketide programmedly.

We propose making a bandage that contains our engineered bacteria behind a semipermeable membrane, allowing only small peptides such as RIP to pass through, into the wound.

","When generating flow through a microcapillary tube, engineers are met with problems in generating force and keeping fluids mixed or separated. Inspired by an article by Kim et al on bacterial carpets that could generate flow, we have designed a biological system in E. coli that can induce flow and increase mixing in a fluid, essentially working as a microscopic flow actuator. The actuator uses E. coli's flagellas and can be switched on and off using light. Our system is composed of several novel parts: a photosensor, that controls the tumbling frequency of E. coli's flagella via chemical pathways; a hyperflagellation part, to increase the number of flagella and the power of the system; a retinal producing part, that works with the 2009 Cambridge's iGEM team's _-Carotene brick, which we have helped further characterize.  Our human practices focused on watermarking synthetic genetic material and improve security in synthetic biology.

","Obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammatory response, which among other things, is triggered by bacterial plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  A high-energy diet, increases the amount of LPS-producing gut microbiota, and increased LPS levels has been observed in obese individuals. By inducing changes in the gut microbiota by prebiotics, like inulin, it is possible to decrease the plasma LPS level. This is associated with the stimulation of bifidobacterial growth. We have designed a novel approach to address this issue of plasma LPS, by probioticly induce changes in the gut flora by genetically modifying a bacteria to produce plant originated inulin. We cloned the two genes encoding sucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase (SST) and fructose:fructose fructosyltransferase (FFT) from the Jerusalem artichoke into a E. coli, where it will produce inulin by using sucrose as an acceptor molecules. In the future this construct should be introduced by a probiotic lactobacillus, into the gut.

Our project aims to make an E. coli strain able to produce natural rubber while grown under controlled conditions. Natural rubber is composed of polymerized IPP (isopentenyl pyrophoshate) units. E. coli already possesses the ability to produce IPP, but it lacks the polymerization enzyme, prenyltransferase, from the rubber tree. In this project we introduce prenyltransferase into E. coli and simultaneously manipulate the bacteria to produce more of the IPP links, consequently leading to the production of natural rubber in the bacterial setting.

Therefore we propose an alternative to antibodies; peptide aptamers – produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The variable loop of the peptide aptamer is generated through a random nucleotide library and held together by an enzymatic inactive version of human Thioredoxin (hThx) as a scaffold protein. We are using the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen for functioning peptide aptamers that are able to bind our chosen target proteins (‘antigens’). In this model bacteria expressing a functioning peptide aptamer will express Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), which enables us to isolate them. To challenge the antibody tradition, we are also proposing a production model.

We are working on a preventive band-aid consisting of recombinant spider silk with integrated antimicrobial peptides, thereby reducing the need for conventional antibiotics. We use spider silk due to its angiogenetic properties and proliferative effect on keratinocytes. The silk with the antimicrobial peptides will be attached to the plastic polymer, poly-β-hydroxy butyrate (PHB), with which our entire construct becomes biodegradable and immune-neutral.

This pathway is controlled by a certain wavelength of red light, acting as a system switch for lacZ production. LacZ can react with substrate X-gal and form a blue precipitate as a reporter. However, other reporter genes can be attached to the lacZ gene, so different reporters can be expressed. From the fact that this mechanism is sensitive to a certain wavelength of light, we hope to create a system that can be sensitive to various wavelengths and hence triggering different protein generation. Through this the E.coli can become a wavelength sensor; a different wavelength can trigger a different production of protein, for example various types of fluorescent protein, giving a different a colour-scaled indication of the wavelength of the environment around the E.coli.

","Antibiotic resistance has been declared by the World Health Organisation as “one of the biggest threats to global health”. Over-prescription of antibiotics is a major issue promoting antibiotic resistance. We have designed a device that aims to rapidly distinguish bacterial infections, thereby preventing mis-prescription of antibiotics. 
In the war for iron, bacteria produce siderophores that scavenge Fe3+ from blood. In response, the immune system produces lipocalin-2 which sequesters siderophores. Lipocalin-2 levels can increase 5-fold during a bacterial infection. Our device detects this difference by utilising Fur, an iron-dependant repressor regulating levels of RyhB which acts as an inverter repressing GFP, our reporter protein. Therefore, bacterial infection results in a weak GFP signal in contrast to a strong signal in patients without bacterial infection.

Synthetic biologists have been engineering genes and pathways in the cell to let it perform functions they desire. However, these man-made pathways incorporated in cytoplasm may suffer inferences from the original genes and pathways within the cell. Eukaryotic cells have organells that separate important pathways from that in the cytoplasm. Thus we want to make our own organells that perform the designed function. There has been some works on man-made organells, however this year the team of Shenzhen plan to create our man-made organell and apply it to organic synthesis by engineering yeast mitochondria, which we call Yeast Artificial Organell, and YAO for short.

Aflatoxin is a highly toxic substance which exists on grains. The most poisonous kind of aflatoxin is Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1).
Since it is difficult to degrade the toxin, we decided to use ScFv (single chain variable region fragments), an antibody, to neutralize it. We used ScFv to neutralize AFB1 because it has been used before and its molecular modification is easy.
We used ScFv, SH3 ligand and 6*his-tag to construct fusion protein so that it can combine with SH3 domain. In this way we can use cells to recover the ScFv that have been expressed out to reduce the antibody-antigen complex that exists on grains. We anchored SH3 domain on E.coli's cell membrane LGT to recover the ScFv.

Runoff can carry field pesticide into aquatic environment while wind can carry them to other fields, potentially affecting other species. Over time, repeated application increases pest resistance and facilitate the pest resurgence. Further, especially in China, toxic pesticide residues on green vegetable and fruits become a major public health problem. 
??In order to provide a solution, we design an engineered bacterium, secreting the OMP enzyme to degrade the common toxic pesticide residues. Its secretion is under the temperature control and can only be activated at specified temperature. To avoid the secondary pollution, a UV-induced suicide gene is inserted into the bacteria: upon exposure to UV or sunshine, the suicide procedure is induced.

","Inspired by the natural regulator of circadian bioclock exhibited in most eukaryotic organisms, our team has designed an E.coli-based genetic network derived from the toxin-antitoxin system (TA system).   The relE protein?toxin?, is an RNase that preferentially cleaves mRNA stop codons, severely inhibiting translation and preventing colony formation. Whereas expression of relB protein?antitoxin? and tmRNA forms a rescue system to reverse inhibitory effects. Based on these mechanisms our network functions as a bacterial bioclock oscillating between the two states of dormancy and activity. Potential applications of our project include lifespan prolongation of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, since the metabolic process of microbes is vastly decelerated during the dormancy state, just like that of bears and hedgehogs in their hibernation.

","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease in which joint matrix is degraded and chondrocytes undergo disordered and hypertrophic differentiation, symptoms including joint pain, tenderness and stiffness. We proposed two synthetic-biological approaches to OA, one with a eukaryotic genetic circuit and another prokaryotic. Both circuits are composed of three systems: 'Detector', 'Actuator' and 'Supervisor'. As for Detector, we built tissue-specific promoters in the eukaryotic circuit, while inflammation factors are employed as signals of OA in the prokaryotic circuit. The same Actuator shared by two circuits generates proteins col2a1, which replenishes the degraded matrix, and oct4, which reverses the disordered differentiation. The eukaryotic Supervisor part has an original design in which a photo-sensitive cation channel crosstalks with certain cellular signaling pathways, resulting in the light-controlled expression of col2a1 and oct4; in the counterpart of prokaryotic circuit, both injected inducers and over-population lead the engineered bacteria to suicide, thus attenuating possible side effects.

","In this year’s project, we aim at constructing a set of protein systems on the E.coli cell membrane as carriers of enzymes of assorted reactions. Distinct from linear DNA or RNA scaffolds in the traditional sense, the membrane protein system expands the dimension of reaction space, making possible the framework of numerous complex reactions on the two-dimensional plane, for example, switchable or circular reactions. In such a device, the membrane replaces DNA or RNA scaffolds as an extensive surface for proteins to anchor without limitation of expression amount. More importantly, by gathering the downstream enzymes through signal regulation, the reaction can be accelerated sharply. Besides, products can be transported much more efficiently from the inside to the outside of the cell in that the enzymes are tied to the membrane proteins. Hence the membrane is where the magic happens.

The translation of the protein can be finely turned up/down with the control of the number of rare codons and the different strength of tRNA induction. Besides, our device can be made into a real switch that can be turned on/off without background protein expression in two ways. One is to use any codon but initial codons to initiate translation, the other is to use stop codon as the controlling element.

This year we aim to combine two systems together in order to provide a universal and convenient tool which can be used to regulate different genomic genes simultaneously and independently in a quantitative way. 

Our project involves the newly developed gene regulating tool CRISPRi and three light-controlled expression systems induced by red, green, and blue light respectively. Simply by changing the regulating parts in CRISPRi system towards mRFP, luciferase, and three enzymes, we hope to prove our system can be used qualitatively, quantitatively and practically step by step.

","This year, we will engineer a recombinant cyanobacteria to achieve “biodesalination”, which means to extract sodium chloride from seawater through biological membranes. There are already some methods to convert saltwater into freshwater, such as distillation and reverse osmosis. However, the high energy consumption of these technologies has limited their application. Therefore the development of an innovative, low-energy biological desalination process, by biological membranes of cyanobacteria, would be very attractive. Many cyanobacteria possess salt-tolerance mechanisms, among which sodium export is the most important one. Halorhodopsin is a light-driven inward-directed chloride pump from halobacteria. We will functionally express it in cyanobacteria to drive influx of chloride together with sodium, thus conferring cyanobacteria the ability to absorb salts to a significant degree.

Biological systems provide an attractive opportunity to design and easily manufacture material with programmable properties.

Furthermore, large quantities of these substances are needed because of their distribution throughout the body. This, coupled with expensive production and especially purification, imposes a great burden on health systems. We aim to develop a safe and cost-effective biological delivery system for biopharmaceuticals, which would increase the quality of patients' lives, because it would minimize the number of required procedures.

","Butanol has proven to be effective as a biofuel and can be used in internal combustion engines without modification, thus reducing the need for already scarce oil. In nature, bacteria of Clostridium genus have been shown to produce butanol from butanoic acid. In the present study, C. acetobutylicum metabolic pathway for butanol production was introduced into E. coli via a construct, consisting of three genes (CtfA, CtfB and BdhB). Polypeptide CtfAB converts butyrate to butyryl-CoA, which is then transformed to butanol by means of BdhB dehydrogenase. Butyrate is formed as an intermediate product in a reaction pathway of direct biological conversion of waste. We successfully composed an optimized system of bioreactors to produce pure butanol and use all side products formed. In the first stage the waste is converted to biogas, natural fertilizer and butyrate, the latter being efficiently transformed to biobutanol in the second stage.

","Our personal health care taker E.coli expresses two proteins SDF-ELP and LL37 which can significantly promote chronic skin wound healing. Chronic skin wounds are characterized by poor re-epithelialization, angiogenesis and granulation. SDF (topical stromal cell-derived growth factor-1), though found effective to re-epithelialization, is rapidly degraded by high levels of protease around wounds. To solve this issue, we fuse SDF1 to ELP(elastin-like peptides) that can aggregate to form nanoparticles so to prevent against proteolysis and promote neovascularization, resulting in much faster re-epithelialization of chronic skin wounds.  We also add an antimicrobial peptide LL-37 to avoid infection by preventing a wide range of bacteria growth.
To enable our health care taker to be used by everyone, we devise a super-convenient product which only needs 4 simple steps “AAPH”( Add. Add. Press. Heat.”) for people to get the final curing proteins.

","The project exploits quorum sensing in E. coli to engineer interactions between 'species' such that complex spatiotemporal patterns are generated. We have two systems that correspond the game 3Rock, Paper, Scissors2 (RPS) and to Conway1s 3Game of Life2 (GoL). In GoL expression/diffusion of lactones is exploited to create local rules that modulate expression of a fluorescent protein. Fluorescence patterns for different combinations of conditions are modelled using a new simulation tool designed to be generically applicable to inter-bacterial communication. In the RPS system three 'species' each produce a different fluorescent protein whose expression is downregulated by a lactone from one of the other 'species' and hence the interaction network is intransitive. Simulations indicate that when this game is played out on culture plates, a range of complex patterns evolve with time. Also, selective patterning of the different 'species' allows for new 'racetrack' or 'playing field' type of interactivity.

","Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs are unable to penetrate the tumour core, and a drug delivery vehicle is needed for effective delivery of therapeutics. Facultative anaerobic bacteria possess the ability to colonise the tumour core, and pose as suitable vectors. To ensure specific control of bacterial vectors, we intend to implement a two switch regulatory system, consisting of an anaerobic-responsive FNR promoter and a quorum-sensing system (QS). 

An anaerobic-responsive FNR promoter can be used to localise transcription of the target gene in the hypoxic tumor core. The second switch will use the esa QS system from Pantoea stewartii to activate bacterial density induced transcription of genes. The above two systems could be coupled to drive the expression of invasin and listeriolysin, which facilitate bacterial invasion and endosomal escape into the cell cytosol. The bacteria vehicle would then be able to deliver an encoded therapeutic into the target tumour cells.

","Homeostasis relies on the balance between immune cell types, disruption of which leads to autoimmunity. The Stanford team has applied synthetic biology to a longstanding objective of immunotherapy: restoration and maintenance of homeostasis.  Stanford’s Escherichia coli-based probiotic will polarize T cell differentiation along antagonistic fates - immunosuppressive Treg and inflammatory Th17 phenotypes - in response to local conditions.  Our device design consists of two parts: one that modulates deleterious Treg-driven immunosuppression and another that engages Th17-mediated inflammation.  Through specific sensors and effectors, therapy will oscillate between dampening pathologic inflammation and immunosuppression until a balance in the local T cell population is achieved.  Securing such homeostasis between these populations has therapeutic implications for autoimmune disorders like IBD, HIV and cancer. We envision our novel and directed probiotic therapy for IBD as acting at the interface between commensal bacteria and human lymphocytes, integrating cutting-edge immunology with synthetic biology.

However, many important biological processes are governed by the ratio between the concentrations of multiple chemicals. To create systems capable of responding to more complex input data, the Stanford team designed two types of ratio-measuring sensors. The first sensor utilizes two unique small RNAs to inhibit the transcription of two operons, each responding to an environmental factor and having a specific flourescent protein (or output gene). By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter.

","Astrobiology revolves around three central questions: “Where do we come from?”, “Where are 
we going?”, and “Are we alone?” The Stanford-Brown iGEM team explored synthetic biology’s untapped potential to address these questions. To approach the second question, the Hell Cell subgroup developed BioBricks that allow a cell to survive harsh extraterrestrial conditions. Such a toolset could create a space-ready synthetic organism to perform useful functions off-world. For example, the Biomining branch attempted to engineer bacteria to recycle used electronics by degenerating silica and extracting metal ions in situ. The Venus Life subproject grappled with the third key astrobiological question by exploring Carl Sagan’s theory that life could exist in Venusian clouds. To this end, Venus Life designed a cell-cycle reporter to test for growth in aerosol within an adapted Millikan apparatus. Through this triad of projects, Stanford-Brown iGEM aimed to illuminate synthetic biology’s value as a tool for astrobiology.

","Space exploration lies at the inquisitive core of human nature, yet high costs hinder the advancement of this frontier. We are harnessing the replicative properties of biology to create biOrigami—biological, self-folding origami—to reduce the mass, volume, and assembly time of materials needed for space missions. biOrigami consists of two main components: manufacturing substrates biologically and bioengineering folding mechanisms. For substrates, we are developing new BioBricks to synthesize two thermoplastics: polystyrene and polyhydroxyalkanoates. For folding mechanisms, we are using heat-induced contraction of thermoplastics and the contractile properties of bacterial spores. After consulting with experts, we believe that biOrigami could be incorporated into rovers, solar sails, and more. In addition to biOrigami, we are creating a novel method to efficiently transform bacteria by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, benefitting the broader synthetic biology community. Our project integrates and improves manufacturing processes for space exploration on both the micro and macro levels.

Our team is working to create a completely biological balloon that is light, that is potentially biodegradable, and that can be both continuously and sustainably produced. To make the balloon itself, we are engineering bacteria to produce membrane polymers with different properties. To inflate the balloon, we are using algae to produce biological hydrogen to fill the balloon. To increase balloon durability, we are looking for biological ways to make our materials radiation resistant. Finally, to functionalize our balloon we are creating biological temperature and small molecule sensors. When combined to form a biological balloon these projects could create a completely novel category of scientific instrument: cheap, light, durable, and useful.

We have used synthetic biology to fuse cell-penetrating peptides to proteins that are deficient in skin of vitiligo patients. The cell-penetrating peptides will aid in passing the proteins through the skin and target the pigment cells to reach repigmentation.

Therefore, we created a novel class of chimeric receptors based on the bacterial osmoregulator EnvZ. We substituted a part of the periplasmic domain of EnvZ with an exchangable, but highly-specific protein binder, an Affibody molecule. Upon antigen binding, the receptor would trigger the OmpR signaling cascade leading to the production of quorom sensing molecules which activate transcription of a fluorescent signal in a separated read-out strain. Taken together, this system could be a transferable method for biomarker detection.

","As a part of the iGEM competition, we decided to develop a new process, allowing the protection of the active biological principle. This type of process exists already, and it is called a vector. It may be biological as viruses, or chemicals as polymeric nanoparticles. Whatsoever its nature, the vector encounters many problems : Stability, targeting, membrane passage, and the immune response. Therefore, we tried to achieve the ideal vector, being the most stable as possible, can easily penetrate its targets, and outwit the immune system. We have created a double vectorization system, by using jointly a bacteria and a phage. The first vector which is bacterial, will target the tissue, and resist to the immune system. The second vector is a phage, will be used for cell targeting and? membrane penetration.  The combination of the two systems improves the intrinsic abilities of vectors, and offers new possibilities for applications.

","In this project, we want to establish a more effective HIV-curing system with less side-effects by integrating CRISPR/Cas system into human hematopoietic stem cells, which aims to protect the helper T cells from virus infection. The gRNA is designed to target the relative conserved regions in HIV viral genome and inactivate its biological activity. Since viral vectors seem to be of limited use in gene therapy strategies (e.g., potential pathogenicity), there is still a need for a simple, efficient nucleic acid transfer system which allows the target-cell-specific introduction of nucleic acids. By using non-viral DNA delivery system like A-B-toxin-GAL4 fusion protein, we can deliver plasmids encoding gRNA into the helper T cells and readily attack multiple HIV genome sites simultaneously and update the targets along with our knowledge of HIV.

From the secondary structure, we  proposed an algorithm that can calculate terminator efficiency. In the aspect of experiment, we construct 100 terminators. We measure the the terminator efficiency by measuring the GFP and RFP which are placed before and after terminators. The efficiency calculated from theoretical model fit quite well with experimental results.  We also created a software and a web surver  for people to calculate their terminators and also built a database of terminator efficiency which we believe to be the largest database of such kind.

Subsequently, bacterial-two-hybrid system was used to give selection pressure on these candidates. Only the favorable candidate proteins can activate compensating gene transcription and rescue phage budding, thus enriching favorable protein sequence in the phage population. Moreover, an RNA thermometer, on the compensating gene mRNA, was applied in the phage amplification process to make it more controllable.

","With great power to suppress adaptive immune system as well as innate immune system, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for cell-based therapy to treat inflammatory diseases, such as IBD, encephalitis, etc. However, clinical trials of MSCs have demonstrated that only a few MSCs can indeed arrive at the inflamed tissue after systematic administration and exert their immunomodulatory function due to the inefficient homing ability of MSCs.
This year, MSCs of next generation are coming. In our project, we will
1) Empower MSCs with a series of chemokine receptors in order to ensure its effective homing.
2) Introduce several kinds of positioning system, such as luciferase to locate in vivo MSC and assure their arrival at the inflamed tissue.
3) Design a switch to kill MSCs when they differentiate into other types of cells.
Finally, we will confirm our engineered MSCs in animal models, such as IBD and DTH.

In the eye, a natural antioxidant glutathione (GSH)—produced by the enzyme glutathione reductase (GSR)—exists to combat oxidation, but GSH levels decrease with age. Studies have also suggested that another enzyme—25-hydroxylase (CH25H)—can convert cholesterol in the eye into 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which reverses crystallin aggregation. We expressed and purified GSR and CH25H for the prevention and treatment of cataracts, respectively.

","In Costa Rica, a man dies of prostate cancer every 27 hours in average, mainly because of late diagnostic. This compelled us to design a new diagnostic method using molecular techniques. For this, we use dCas9, inactive variant of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, to bind to an RNA biomarker found in the urine of men with prostate cancer. This dCas9 is engineered with a protease, which is released when the Cas9 binds to the biomarker RNA, due to a conformational change. The released protease cleaves a fluorescent protein-quencher dimer, thus allowing the FP to fluoresce and generating a measurable signal.

","Bacterial reporters or whole-cell bacterial sensors have always been an area of application for genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago, although these early tests didn't use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the area of genetic engineering has resulted in newer and more sophisticated bacterial sensors, capable of detecting the presence of contaminants, sugars and amino acids in different media such as soil and water. However, most bacterial sensors can only detect the presence of a compound at a certain concentration and currently there are few documented bacterial sensors that can detect and report different concentrations of the compound of interest. Our objective was to develop a genetic frame, compatible with the BioBrick standard, for the creation of a concentration-sensitive bacterial sensor. In the process we also developed and characterized BioBricks for two new families of phage activators.

","Appetite can shape a person's life, from body composition to mood (to budget!), yet the means for controlling appetite are very limited.  Imagine if a complex neurological state such as the desire to eat could be influenced by an engineered strain of intestinal microflora.  In this regard, Peptide Tyrosine Tyrosine (PYY) and its associated molecules offer a unique opportunity for synthetic biologists.  These peptides permit microorganisms native to the gastrointestinal tract to interact with the central nervous system and to influence the perception of hunger.  The Citadel-Charleston Team is working to express the PYY family of peptides in E.coli, to implement a secretion pathway for those peptides, and to ensure that their expression is strictly controlled by means of a cellular population limit.

Alk-Sensor is composed of ALKR protein——a transcriptional regulatory protein, and promoter alkM. ALKR recognizes alkanes and their interaction triggered a conformation change of ALKR dimers which isomerizes the promoter-RNAP complex and led to activate the downstream genes of PalkM.

To solve these problems, extending engineering capabilities from single-cell behaviors to multi-cellular microbial consortia brings us new inspiration. So we establish a co-cultured MFC system with an elaborate labor division.

To do this, we aim to create the following: ?cells that ingest cholesterol to decrease blood cholesterol levels, healthy low calorie breads, a system in which periodic gene expression is controlled, and bacteria that encourage smokers to quit smoking, respectively. By applying similar synthetic biology ?methodologies to these, prevention of numerous lifestyle-related diseases may become reality, serving as a first step towards their eradication.

","We propose an entirely new Escherichia coli micro machine that behaves like a tanker, the EcoTanker. The EcoTanker takes up a target compound from the environment and delivers it to a desired location for easy harvesting. The target compound is taken up and stored inside the cell in an EcoTank, a bacterial microcompartment (pduABJKNU). Blue light then directs the delivery of the 'cargo' to a desired destination by phototaxis, using the N. pharaonis blue light responsive domain (NpSRII-NpHtrII-Tar) linked to an E. coli two component system. The EcoTankers are then signaled by green light to self-aggregate and autolyse in response to quorum sensing. We can then easily collect the EcoTanks filled with the target compound, which could be an environmentally toxic substance or an industrially desirable chemical. We expect that EcoTanker to be a powerful machine in various bioremediation and industrial applications.

","Tokyo-NokoGen has developed the Escherichia coli Auto Protein Synthesizer (ESCAPES), an E. coli machine that greatly simplifies the production of your favorite protein. We created a green light-activated actuator to respond to external light signals, as well as a riboregulator-based signal counter to count the number of flashes. In ESCAPES, the first green light flash induces the E. coli to self-aggregate, while the second flash causes them to auto-lyse, thus greatly simplifying the protein preparation process. The light-activated actuator was constructed by fusing the light responsive domain of the Synechocystis photoreceptor CcaS with the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. Self-aggregation is achieved by the induction of the Antigen43 gene, which we isolated from E. coli, while autolysis took advantage of the available BioBrick parts endolysin and holin. ESCAPES helps you “escape” from tedious protein preparation steps, such as centrifugation and cell disruption.

 To design an artificial fast responding oscillating circuit, we designed an　RNA-based oscillator. We used RNA-responsive self-cleavage ribozymes whose cleavage is regulated by an RNA molecule. The ribozyme cleavage cuts-off an “RNA scaffold” that harbors RNA aptamers. This aptamer binds to its specific target proteins, which are directly fused to reporter protein. This binding recruits the already translated split reporter protein complementation resulting in the output (twinkles).　Our system enabled fast response and short oscillation cycle.

","""ExTermite coli” is a novel system to exterminate termites, which combines an engineered Escherichia coli and a unique pseudo-egg delivery system. The E. coli was engineered to overexpress glucose-3-dehydrogenase (G3DH), which converts trehalose into the trehalase inhibitor 3,3’-diketo-trehalose (3,3’dkt). Because trehalose is a major termite blood sugar and trehalase is essential for trehalose metabolism, G3DH essentially converts trehalose into an insecticide. The pseudo-egg delivery system takes advantage of a habit termites have of carrying their eggs to their nests and licking them. Termites recognize their eggs by sensing β-glucosidase and lysozyme, which act as egg-recognition pheromones. The pseudo eggs, containing both termite egg-recognition molecules and engineered E. coli, will be delivered to their nests and then licked by the termites present, thus allowing the  G3DH produced by the E. coli to convert trehalose into insecticide inside the termite bodies. Consequently ExTermite coli can effectively exterminate termites in their nest.

	Ninjas are also known for their star-shaped ‘shuriken’ throwing knives. Our E. coli ninja has a similar weapon, an M13 phage which it releases to infect other E. coli, injecting plasmid DNA into them. 
	Finally, ninja must harmonize with the natural environment, so their relationship to it is very important. Plant hormones help plants to grow efficiently, and we are attempting to construct a circuit that synthesizes two plant hormones depending on the soil environment.

","Oil sands, consisting of a mixture of clay, sand and bitumen represent a significant fraction of remaining petroleum reserves.  However, extracting the hydrocarbons requires large volumes of water which are then contaminated with naphthenic acids, heavy metals and residual hydrocarbons.  These 'tailings' are acutely toxic to higher organisms, though some bacteria and algae can survive in these environs.  Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited.  However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient.  The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA.  Metabolic channeling is an effect whereby intermediates are shuttled between enzymes in a pathway circumventing free diffusion into the cytosol.  Here, we present a design, modeling and baseline experiments aimed at demonstrating optimization of catechol degradation using the principle of metabolic channeling in an E. coli proof of concept system.

","Fungi capable of producing harmful mycotoxins flourish on a variety of widely consumed crops, notably bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and grains. Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where lack of advanced food storage and mycotoxin exposure are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. As such, our team focused on developing a secretable chitinase capable of hydrolysing the glycosidic bonds which compose the polysaccharide chitin, a key structural component in fungal cellular walls. By fusing LbCHI31 chitinase-encoding genes with a secretion signal peptide from alpha-amylase, we successfully generated an escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase specific to fusarium oxysporum, a major pathogenic fungi. LbCHI31 extracellular secretion and effectiveness were further quantified through characterization and analysis. This project will allow for easily accessible, cost-effective methods for producing effective chitinases that combat fungal infections, thereby increasing crop yield, stabilizing financial growth, and reducing famine globally.

","Darwinian evolution shows great power in creating incredible biological function in amazing speed. Inspired by this, our team aimed at creating novel fast and irrational microbial cell factory by simulating natural Darwinian evolution process. With tryptophan as target product, a novel tryptophan biosensor utilizing translating ribosome mechanism was firstly developed as the foundation for tryptophan productivity and selection pressure switch module. We further constructed this tryptophan overproduction selection gene circuit coupling with in vivo mutation machine (mutator gene of mutD). By fine-tuning the selection conditions, our selection circuit showed good tryptophan dependent growth property, which provides the foundation for further evolution. As a preliminary result of this project, we successfully evolved an ancestor with zero productivity to a high-tryptophan producer only after several rounds of evolution.

","Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus causes major problems, especially in hospitals, leading to over half a million infections annually in the US alone. Of the alternative treatments currently under investigation one of the more promising is through antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). These small, highly-specific peptides attack the membrane of target organisms. Thousands of AMPs are known to exist and little resistance against them has been developed. 
The Peptidor project consists of an E. coli that can detect S. aureus, using S. aureus’ native quorum sensing system, in order to locally produce and deliver AMPs.  Upon detection, peptides inactivated by a SUMO-tag fusion, are overexpressed. After a delay period, introduced through a negative transcriptional cascade, a SUMO protease is expressed cleaving off the inactivating tag. Using this mechanism, high concentrations of peptide are delivered at the infection to efficiently kill S. aureus.  As a safety mechanism, the timer also activates an E. coli kill-switch.

","Lacking a genetically strict sex determination system, fish are very sensitive to hormonally active agents in water. The extensive use of fertilizers and the inability of sewage treatment plants to break down drug waste lead to increasingly high concentrations of so-called endocrine disruptors in rivers. As a result, male fish have been found to be less fertile and even develop female sex tissue, so called ovotesties. Since fish spawn is constantly exposed to river waters, fish development is easily disturbed, and while the ratio of female fish increases, population numbers decrease. For sensing we use a membrane-bound receptor of Danio rerio. Activation will lead to bioluminescence which can be read out by photometric measurement.

","Detrimental alterations caused to water bodies by endocrine disruptive chemicals are an increasing problem in our environment. Especially steroid hormones influence the development and generative behavior of fish. The binding of those hormones to progestogen receptors can mistime the reproductive behavior of aquatic organisms and thereby endanger population balance.
Our aim is to construct a yeast-based measurement system for progestin concentration in water samples. Many currently used methods are either very expensive or significantly slower than our method will be. We take advantage of membrane bound receptors in order to achieve high specificity and to speed up measurement.
The binding of the ligand to the receptor stops inhibition of the reporter and thereby initiates its expression through a sensitive signaling-chain. This transcriptional switch allows measurement of very small amounts of substrate. To improve our system we use different interchangeable parts for assembly to get a high variety of possible applications.

","Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become the most widely manufactured synthetic polymer. With annual production exceeding 100 million tons (2010), it creates an issue of PET waste. In Western countries less than 70% of PET production is recovered by recycling. Biological processes play no role so far, only expensive chemical processes are applicable yet. PET waste left to erosion in the environment creates nanoparticles which tend to accumulate toxic substances. This poses a growing environmental threat and a serious health risk. Thus, developing new methods for PET degradation has become an urgent issue. Team TUD designed a bacterial recycling system that uses PET waste as a resource for synthesis of new chemical compounds. The proposed solution pursues PET decomposition into its monomers, transportation into E. coli and leading via terephthalic acid (TPA) to a high-value end product. The latter’s specification is determined by the inserted enzymes to build new metabolic pathways.

","The danger of fungal contamination of grains and cereals but also other food sources has severe consequences. Undetected contaminations can render large quantities of food stocks useless – with detrimental effects on the economy and the food supply.

We want to develop a handy device which allows an easy, fast and reliable detection of mycotoxins. 

For that our team uses various methods from the fields of synthetic biology, electrical engineering and information processing.

Our system relies on E. coli with modified TAR receptor interacting with specific mycotoxins. If these are present in the sample they induce a conformational change of TAR and thereby generates a measurable FRET-beacon by bringing two fluorophores in close distance to each other.

The modified E. coli will be embedded in exchangeable capsules. Together with a handheld-device and a controlling Smartphone App they will guarantee that measurements can be done quickly, easy to operate and secure.

","This year the team aims to achieve victory in the championship of synthetic biology by investigating a new approach to produce a plant pigment called Anthocyanin in Escherichia coli (E. coli). This class of pigment not only stains blossoms in blue, violet or red but also is enclosed in fruits and is valued for its antioxidant effect as well as the ability to lower the risks for cancer. 
In the team’s technological approach, the anthocyanin dye can be utilised to build so-called “Gr?tzel cells”. These electrochemical dye-sensitized solar cells use the produced dye instead of a semiconductor material for the absorption of light. The objective is to investigate an innovative approach for a sustainable energy source; wherever and whenever needed. In the course of the project phase, the team will construct a Gr?tzel cell testing their dye that was produced in E. coli.

","3D-printing has become a highly applicable technique, improving numerous engineering processes including rapid prototyping. The technique allows the production of almost any imaginable structure. A variety of 3D-printing methods have been developed, for instance Stereolithography (SLA) - enabling the realization of many utilization options. We produce monomer compounds in E.coli, nominal xylitol, itaconic acid and ethylene glycol by metabolic engineering. Those compounds were combined by a chemical hydrolysis reaction creating a pre-polymer. The final polymerization reaction is promoted when defined light waves hit the pre-polymer liquid transforming it into a solid polymer. We want to use this technology to advance medical engineering. In cooperation with Synenergene, we developed an application scenario to identify the best way to provide an accurate on-site matching prosthesis to victims of forced amputations. Fast and accurate production of those parts in one piece could render quick and easy help, especially in crisis areas.

To this end, we want to generate a safety approach to enable all iGEM Teams to work safely with E.coli. 
A genetic circuit is integrated into the E.coli genome ensuring that genetically modified E.coli cannot survive outside of the required conditions. This genetic circuit is based on the availability of an unnatural amino acid (UAA) which continuously has to be added to the medium. A reporter protein is expressed as the level of UAA in the medium decreases, signalizing the low UAA concentration. If the level decreases further, the expression of colicin is induced, resulting in the death of the bacteria.

Using the shuttle vector pYES2, which was adapted to the iGEM standard, transient transfection and expression in yeast were achieved. The gene products were subsequently characterized and their biosynthetic activities investigated.
Constitutive, alcohol-inducible and light-switchable promoter systems were developed, to individually regulate the expression of these gene cassettes. By combining these BioBricks our team has been able to brew iGEM’s first and finest SynBio Beer.

","In Taiwan there are 9 power stations generating energy by coal, and produce 269.1 million tons of CO2 every year. Power stations are major causes of global warming. Therefore, we would like to create a ” biolight” system that can reduce CO2 production and attenuate degree of global warming.?We plan to create a new organism that doesn’t need electricity and cause no pollution. We named it “Midnight Apollo”. ?The “Midnight Apollo” will be turned on when surrounding area turns dark and will be turned off automatically when the environment becomes bright. The idea is based on two systems, Cph8 and aeoquorin/GFP. The Cph8 is regulated by visible light that can activate protein translation of an illuminating system. Subsequently, this illuminating system would use aeoquorin/GFP to light up the environment.?We hope The Midnight Apollo could be applied in producing energy-saved Bio-streetlamp, emergency Biolighting, or Biosearchlight.

","Directed evolution engineers organisms to produce proteins of novel function and industrially relevant biomolecules. Traditionally, in vivo directed evolution relies on physical or chemical mutagens that cause accumulation of toxic and nonspecific deleterious mutations. A novel system, termed feedback-regulated evolution of phenotype (FREP), overcomes these problems by incorporating a variable mutation rate system to mimic natural evolution. This is achieved through the dynamic control of a mutator element negatively regulated by the desired end product. The 2014 UChicago iGEM team implemented and optimized FREP in E. coli, using the tyrosine pathway as a proof of concept. We combined multiple mutators with different biases for a deeper exploration of the search space, increasing the initial mutation rate and speeding the accumulation of beneficial mutations. Eliminating mutational bias should increase sequence space search efficiency, significantly improving the process of directed evolution for industrial production of any biomolecule.

","Industrial Agriculture produces enormous quantities of excess, sugar-rich biomass not fit for human consumption. We believe that the tools of synthetic biology can be used to take advantage of this surplus by converting it to high value products and minimizing the amount of waste in agriculture. With this project we engineered bacteria to transform almond hulls into erythritol, a zero-calorie sweetener with a fast growing market. We take on the high cost of sugar alternatives, directly addressing diabetes and obesity, using the underutilized biomass of inedible agricultural co-products. Through public discussion, surveys, expert interviews, and cost analysis, we believe we can utilize synthetic biology to convert non-food almond co-products into Erythritol. In order to push our platform off the benchtop and into the real world, we considered the production costs of this product, and built a low cost bioreactor and purification system to directly address the price point.

","Some eukaryotic cells, such as white blood cells, have the amazing ability to sense specific external chemical signals, and move toward those signals. This behavior, known as chemotaxis, is a fundamental biological process crucial to such diverse functions as development, wound healing and immune response. Our project focuses on using a synthetic biology approach to manipulate signaling pathways that mediate chemotaxis. We are attempting to reprogram the movements that the cells undergo by altering the guidance and movement machinery of these cells in a modular way. For example, can we steer them to migrate toward new signals? Can we make cells move faster? Slower?  We hope to better understand how chemotaxis works, and eventually build cells that can perform useful tasks. Imagine, for example, therapeutic cell-bots that could home to a directed site in the body and execute complex, user-defined functions (e.g., kill tumors, deliver drugs, guide stem cell migration).

","Cytotoxic cells of the immune system (Natural killers and cytotoxic T cells) identify cancer and virally-infected cells and kill them. These potent killers travel throughout the body, recognizing proteins and other molecules on the surface of target cells. If the target cell is deemed potentially dangerous, the cytotoxic cell grips the target cell tightly and creates an immunological synapse at the site of adhesion. Within this immunological synapse, the killer cell releases cytotoxic granules to kill the target cell without harming any nearby cells allowing for a direct, apoptotic death.   Our team will focus on improving the specificity and killing efficiency of cytotoxic cells towards certain cancer types. By using synthetic biology tools and logic gates' design, we hope to create powerful killing biomachines for the fight against cancer. Our newly engineered synthetic devices would have the potential to enhance current adoptive cell-based immunotherapy for cancer patients.

This year, the UCSF iGEM team has engineered artificial biofilms via yeast cell surface display.

","One major goal of synthetic biology is to use common chassis (E. coli, yeast) for the production of drugs and useful natural products. This practice often requires placing large enzymatic pathways into one cell. Production of the desired product is usually affected by increased metabolic burden or negative feedback on the cell. In nature, however, many organisms work symbiotically to accomplish a task and/or provide mutual benefits to one another. For the first part of our project, we have studied two systems to create cellular codependence in E. coli - using either pairs of auxotrophs or toxin/antitoxins. In the second part of our project, we split a model metabolic pathway (violacein production) between two separate strains. Our goal is to create a tunable system to control population ratio of strains in co-culture in order to maximize the yield of a product.

We combine bacterial conjugation with CRISPRi, an RNAi-like repression system developed from bacteria,  to regulate gene expression in targeted strains within a complex microbial community. One possible application is to selectively repress pathogenic genes in a microbiome, leaving the community makeup unaffected. In addition, we use CRISPRi to lay the groundwork for transferring large circuits that enable complex functionality and decision-making in cells.

","Cells in a local population have a wide range of responses to a given stimulus, potentially due to differences in extracellular environment or intracellular molecular composition. However, cellular communities often need to resolve this variation to respond in a concerted and robust way. Our project seeks to understand complex intercellular interactions underlying specific community phenotypes by engineering communication motifs with the goal of reaching a community behavior to either converge or diverge in response. To do this, we have engineered novel sense-and-secrete circuits into yeast. To model community signaling, we repurposed endogenous yeast mating factor alpha(MFα) as an extracellular signal. Our designed circuit outputs initial individual responses to stimuli as GFP signal and, after signaling through secreted MFα, a downstream community-coordinated response is reported as RFP signal. By tuning parameters like positive and negative feedback strength and MFα-sensitivity, we hope to develop a circuit capable of analyzing cellular community interactions.

","Synchronization of biological processes in populations is essential to achieve strong measurable and functional traits. Circadian rhythms are one of nature's most exquisite mechanisms to regulate and synchronize biological processes over time. Our team has taken advantage of the fine time control offered by the circadian clock machinery to construct a genetic circuit that allows robust oscillatory behavior in a synchronized and predictable manner. We have coupled the expression of genes of a bioluminescent pathway to the endogenous circadian clock of Synechocystis PCC 6803. The benefits of using Synechocystis as our chassis for practical applications include minimal production costs due to its autotrophic growth capacity and precise synchronization to time-dependent events using environmental cues such as light. As a direct application we designed the first self-rechargeable programmable bio-lamp. Secondary projects include a novel secretion system, the first spider-silk biobrick and an optimization of the Gibson assembly reaction for small parts.

","Compartmentalization is a characteristic of complex biological systems. Carboxysomes are proteinaceous bacterial microcompartments that evolved to optimize bacterial metabolic reactions. We sought to take advantage of this biological principle to design a platform for in vitro metabolic engineering. Whateversisome it’s based on two hypotheses: the targeting signal to the microcompartment is present in a subunit of RuBisCO and that after isolation Carboxysomes can maintain their metabolic capacity in vitro. To address these hypotheses, we designed a system to target proteins of interest to the Carboxysome using RuBisCO subunits as targeting signals. We showed colocalization of GFP fusion proteins and Carboxysome shell-proteins fused to RFP. Second, we designed a simple system for Carboxysome purification based on biotinylation that should enable easy isolation of recombinant Whateversisomes. Our approach would enable combinatorial in vitro metabolic engineering by producing and combining arbitrary Whateversisomes. This project takes advantage of subcellular organizational principles for metabolic engineering.

We have designed a bacterial secretion system that could be used in a probiotic organism to secrete an enzyme to degrade the allergen gliadin before it reaches the intestine. A putative advantage a probiotic treatment over direct enzyme therapy approaches is the potential for administering fewer doses, thus making it less troublesome, less costly, and more convenient. ?Our secretion system consists of an inducible promoter, ribosome binding site, an extracellular anchor (ompA/INPNC), cleavage signal sequence, 6 HIS Tag and a terminator.?

","Genetic circuits regulating spatial pattern formation play vital roles in organismal development throughout the eukaryotic domain.  We believe that we can use related design principles to synthesize spatial patterning in bacterial populations.  Previous genetic devices have allowed bacterial lawns to faithfully reproduce spatial patterns and, with the inclusion of of cell-cell communication, to construct of a bacterial edge detection device.  Our device builds on these ideas but differs significantly by aspiring to produce complex spatial patterns in response to simple stimuli rather than by copying the input stimulus.  This genetic circuit could drive the creation of biological systems capable of generating spatially varying gene expression profiles in response to simple chemical stimuli.  Such devices should have application in fields such as nanofabrication, environmental engineering and tissue engineering.

Our team has developed a rapid, inexpensive and accurate technique to measure oil quality. We have built an electrochemical sensor that incorporates engineered enzymes to detect a spectrum of aldehydes that serve as a proxy of rancidity. Computational analysis and custom hardware that includes signal filtering, processing and optimization of chemical kinetics allows us to perform multi-compound detection and hence olive oil quality control in a highly reproducible manner. Current and future collaboration with olive oil producers and distributors will pave the way for a widely-applicable platform with far-fetching consumer applications.

By measuring the rate at which triclosan inhibits Fabi, we can make a standard curve of percent inhibition vs triclosan, and use this standard curve to determine how much triclosan is present in a wastewater sample. We are investigating the activity of the Fabi enzyme from 8 different organisms on a panel of non-native substrates to determine the combination of Fabi and substrate that will yield the best results at the lowest cost. We can then engineer the enzyme to have greater specificity on the non-native substrate through computational design and kunkel mutagenesis. By coupling our biosensor with civic engagement measures, our goal is to raise awareness and accountability around environmental concerns and to empower citizens to participate in decisions being made about chemical use.

As a proof of principle, we tested our ability to identify rate limiting steps using the bacterial LUX system, a bioluminescent reaction, in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. We have expressed several permutations of the bacterial LUX metabolic pathway to empirically determine its rate limiting steps by measuring the resulting light production. The identification of rate-limiting steps then allows us to optimize the pathway. Furthermore, with these findings, an improved and experimentally validated mathematical model of the LUX pathway will be constructed. By strategically altering biosynthetic gene expression, we have gained a means to tailor the reporter/sensor to better suit our needs (i.e. make it brighter) and a generalizable method to rapidly optimize metabolic pathways.

In this project, we present CRISPR-X, a sgRNA design tool fully supporting SBOL and BioBricks standards with dynamic algorithm based on intent function, chassis, and newest experimental data. The program can be used on all platforms.

","Synthetic DNA holds a great promise for high-density, long-term and massive information storage. As the cost of DNA synthesis and sequencing decreases at an accelerated pace, practical application of DNA as information storage medium is on the horizon. However, there lacks a bridge to connect the current electronic-based information technology (IT) world with the future DNA-based biotechnology (BT) information world. To address this need, we develop a web-based software tool, Bio101, to encode conventional electronic computer files into nucleotide (nt) sequences and to decode the latter into original data format reversely. Through a five-step process, compression, encryption, bit-to-nt conversion, indexing and validation, Bio101 can convert any computer file into a set of short, non-bioactive DNA sequences which are ready to be delivered to a DNA synthesis company for the physical writing-in.

","Previously, the majority of engineered, genetic regulation within bacteria has been achieved through the use of transcriptional regulators. However, the recent explosion of interest from the emerging field of RNA regulation provides new insights into the dynamic nature of genetic regulation. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) comprise the chief regulatory mechanism for eliciting primary responses to environmental stresses.  Acting in conjunction with proteins such as hfq (RNA chaperone), sRNAs provide a cost-effective, specific and rapid response that is essential in targeting gene transcripts for regulation. The Illinois iGEM team has worked to create a set of endogenous and artificial sRNA regulator Biobricks to be used in cellular stress responses and which contribute to bistability in artificial gene circuits. A bacterial metal detection system of arsenic and gold demonstrates the capacity of sRNA regulation in artificial gene circuits.

","RNA has characteristics that are important in human gene expression (i.e. alternative splicing of mRNA, noncoding RNA). Therefore, a modular RNA binding protein is an invaluable tool for gene regulation. The PUF domain of human PUM1 gene contains eight tandem repeats, each recognizing one of the four nucleotide bases. In theory, a PUF protein can be programmed to recognize any 8-nt ssRNA sequence. Here we demonstrate that PUF can be tethered with other functional domains for applications in E. Coli. Specifically, we show that a PUF/endonuclease fusion protein acts as RNA scissors, silencing gene expression through site specific mRNA cleavage. PUF was also tethered to split GFP to test its ability to co-localize proteins using a RNA scaffold. PUF biobricks offer a wide range of possible functions including gene expression modulation and scaffolding of metabolic pathways.

","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death in the United States for over twenty years and is a rising global health issue. Recent studies demonstrate a correlation between CVD and atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the arteries. One associated risk for atherosclerosis is the production of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) by natural gut flora when metabolizing L-carnitine, a chemical found primarily in red meat and energy drinks. 
 
We created a probiotic to attack the root of this problem by outcompeting the gut bacteria for L-carnitine in order to suppress the production of TMAO. L-carnitine transporters (caiX and cbcWV) and L-carnitine dehydrogenase (CDH) derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were expressed in a safe strain of E. coli (Nissle 1917). This engineered E. coli can uptake and metabolize L-carnitine along an alternative, safe pathway into 3-dehydrocarnitine. Together, this system offers a novel solution in preventing TMAO-related cardiovascular health conditions.

In exchange the plant provides the bacteria with carbon sources and a protected niche inside its root, where Rhizobium etli reaches a hypoxic state. We will exploit this microenvironment to produce hydrogen in Rhizobium etli introducing a pathway assembled with elements from Clostridium acetobutylicum, Desulfovibrio africanus and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, while maintaining nitrogen fixation.The two goals of our project are to make Rhizobium etli a powerful agent in environmental protection by nitrifying soils and producing hydrogen from solar energy, and to standardize the work in Rhizobials.""

Bacillus booleanus is a project that wants to create a “molecular 
computer”. How it works? We are working on the creation of 
different strains of Bacillus subtilis, each one will be able to perform 
a single Boolean operation just like a transistor. A single transistor 
is not a computer, they need to communicate with others to 
perform new logic operations, but how our bacterial transistors can 
communicate? In  2011, Ben-Yehuda et. al. identified a type of 
bacterial communication mediated by nanotubes that bridge 
neighboring cells, providing a network for exchange of cellular 
molecules within and between species. By using these nanotubes 
our bacterium will be capable to communicate with others so that 
create complex networks of logic gates. Using this it could be 
possible to develop a complex network of ""transistors"" to create, for 
example, a synthetic metabolic pathway.

There are at least 4 different virus serotypes which prevalence shifts every year,  patients who suffered one particular serotype become immune for life, but getting another serotype, reaction is so severe that dengue becomes hemorrhagic and lethal most of the times.

We designed synthetic proteins aimed to produce immunological response against dengue. Using databases and for proteins, epitopes and 3D structures programs we found epitopes for L and T white cells. Then selected a protein and inserted on its chain these epitopes from all serotypes, and 4 proteins containing just one serotype.

In conjunction with existing glucose sensitive promoters from the Parts Registry, we used our novel promoters to design a biological device  that expresses different combinations of the three different chromoproteins in response to glucose in Escherichia coli. As such, this device can detect a larger dynamic range of concentrations of selected molecules (e.g., glucose). Our project aims to provide a cheaper alternative for diabetics than current, more expensive, glucose-monitoring systems.

In addition, both bacterial cells activate,  through AHL, an enzyme necessary to convert cellobiose to glucose, which represents the only energy source for the whole consortium. The eukaryotic cell 'C' responds to AHL through a hybrid protein, thereby producing a secreted beta-lactamase, which allows the bacterial cells to grow in the presence of ampicillin.

Where attempts at physical removal and biodegradable plastics have failed to solve this pollution disaster, synthetic biology steps in. UCL’s project proposes the bioremediation of microplastic waste by two systems: degradation using a laccase enzyme or aggregation by controlled expression of curli. Ultimately we envisage the construction of habitable islands - turning waste into a resource. We used novel chassis: two marine bacteria, Oceanibulbus indoliflex  and Roseobacter denitrificans. In line with considering the viability of our project, we questioned the access ordinary citizens should have to these tools. Initiating a new partnership, UCL teamed up with a group of ‘biohackers’ (citizen scientists in molecular biology) to create the world’s first ‘Public BioBrick’.

","Some bacteria naturally bleb: a process whereby their outer membrane pinches in and buds off. The result of this is an outer membrane vesicle (OMV), a nanoscale lipid bubble, released into the environment. These OMVs can be decorated on the outside with outer membrane proteins, and can encapsulate periplasmic proteins within. Given this, OMVs have the potential to be tailored to a variety of functions, by targeting proteins either to the periplasm or outer membrane. This customisable nature means that OMVs could become a new platform technology for the application of future synthetic biology projects. Currently, however, there is no standardised system for inducing hypervesiculation in bacteria, and thus our project compares the effect of different genetic factors on OMV formation. With this data we will produce the ultimate strain of blebbing bacteria which can be utilised for the production of OMVs adapted for environmental, medical, or industry purposes.

","One of the greatest barriers to long term space travel is the exposure to high energy ionizing radiation (IR). Exposure to IR can induce double stranded breaks which are very cytotoxic, resulting in cell death. Current solutions, while effective in low earth orbit, are less so outside of the magnetosphere. The 2016 U of C Calgary team address this problem through synthetic biology and the engineering of Bacillus subtilis. A strain of B. subtilis has been engineered to express a recombinant peptide, Bowman-Birk Protease inhibitor (BBI), which has radio-protective effects. The bacteria are contained within a patch, allowing for continuous secretion of the peptide into the body. While the initial system is designed to produce BBI, restriction sites within the gene constructs allow for any gene to be inserted, creating a versatile expression platform. This can be customized for the secretion of bio-therapeutics for future space missions.

This allows the network to maintain sensitivity despite noise, and also permits response to stimuli in a much larger dynamic range. By modifying the promoter driving the stimulus, the network can be engineered to detect fold-changes of any molecule with a responsive promoter, thereby serving as a structural chassis for the next generation of molecule detectors.

However, this approach does not explain many complex and finely-tuned phenomena in the cell. We believe that a special genetic network, known as a “tri-stable switch,” can model cell differentiation. This network would allow a cell to “specialize” from a quasi-pluripotent state to one of two differentiated states. By repurposing native transcription factors, we can build such a switch in the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or baker’s yeast. If this network can indeed achieve tri-stability, it may give us insight on the mechanisms of differentiation in stem cells, and bring us a step closer to construction synthetic stem cells in the lab.

However, since in most cases bacteria are not drawn towards their targets, the possibility of specific interaction is limited to those bacterial cells that randomly collide with the surface, thus requiring a high bacterial population to achieve efficient targeting. On the other hand, most bacteria are specifically attracted by gradients of a variety of chemicals, thus achieving high cell densities in the areas where the chemoattractants are present at higher concentration. The aim of 'Bacterial Crowding' is to exploit chemotaxis for directing a relatively small population of bacteria to interact efficiently with a non-diffusible target exposed on a biotic or abiotic surface.

","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are produced by various activities, from grilling meat to coal gasification, and are potent carcinogens. Our project aims to degrade PAHs in industrial waste. The current waste handling method for PAHs is simply to deposit them in landfills where they leak into environment. Our cells need to detect the PAHs for the degradation. But the molecules do not readily pass through the membrane. We solved this predicament by using one of the smaller PAHs as an indicator to degrade the heavier PAHs.  The degradation of this small PAH inside the cell relieves repression of genes under the control of the NahR/Psal promoter system. This causes a series of enzymes to get expressed and secreted outside the cell, oxidising and cleaving the ring structures of the carcinogenic compounds, making them available for downstream bio-degradation. To increase the degradation efficiency our system also produces rhamnolipids.

By utilising elements of this pathway, with a novel recovery mechanism, mercury can be accumulated intracellularly and efficiently removed from the environment. The presence of mercury activates MerR, driving the expression of Antigen 43 (Ag43), a self-adhering surface protein. Coupling a mercury sensitive promoter to the expression of Ag43 enables cells to accumulate mercury then aggregate in solution. P. syringae is a ubiquitous airborne bacterium which expresses a unique protein, InaZ. This protein acts as a scaffold for ice nucleation, inducing precipitation.

Each demand can be converted into designing a scoring function to give the evolution process a direction. E.ADEM is designed by implementing evolutionary algorithm back into biology. The core of E.ADEM is a self-adaptive controller that can adjust variation rate and selection pressure, based on fitness score, population size and average fitness score calculated by a quorum sensing device. After comprehensive measurement using constitutive promoter family stimulus signals and modeling of the components, a prototype machine is built.

Then target protein can be located either inside or outside the empty shell by fusing the protein with signal sequences, using a novel and convenient assembly standard compatible with the RFC 10. Onto this platform, artificial organelles with different functions can be constructed. With enzymes or binding proteins inside the shell, different nanoreactors or nanoreservoirs can be produced. Modifications outside the shell can be applied to build multi-protein super-complexes or facilitate downstream purification with affinity tags.

","    USTC team focuses on a kind of yeast prion called Sup35. It shares some properties with normal prion, but it’s harmless. We know that Sup35 aggregates between 37℃ and 42℃, and Guanidine Hydrochloride (GDNHCL) induces aggregated Sup35 to separate.
    We decide to take advantage of three characters of Sup35: assembling, thermal control and reversibility. The first circuit is based on Yeast Two-hybrid System. The aggregation of Sup35 results in the binding of AD and BD, then downstream gene GFP expresses. In the second circuit, we split sfGFP, a variant of GFP, into two fragments: sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11. sfGFP11 is linked to Sup35. sfGFP1-10 spontaneously binds to sfGFP11 to show green fluorescence, however, aggregation of Sup35 inhibits the binding, thus the fluorescence disappears. Being regulated by temperature and GDNHCL, our circuits can be used as biological temperature control kill switch, as biological temperature indicator and in scientific research.

We use the modified promoter pRM to sense the phage’s infection and initiate the defence. The lysis gene which can make bacteria lyse is installed in our circuit. When it works, the phage won’t be able to take advantage of its host to replicate any longer. To win more time for lysis to function well, we design antisense RNA to prevent the phage from turning into lytic life cycle. Thus, when the lysis protein kills the host, the phage is still at lysogenic life cycle or the newly assembled phages are still immature. By using the quorum sensing system, the bacteria around the host will prepare to defend in advance. Attribute to these parts, our bacteria survive.

So that C.crescentus can locate themselves correctly and present image colorfully.

This project answers the question. We use reverse engineering techniques to get mathematical models such as ordinary differential equations(ODEs), directly from the experimental data and build the feasible designs according to the models.

To realize those purposes, importing exogenous genes to target bacteria is universal and essential. In this approach, improve or reduce the expression of target genes through interaction is inevitable. Experiments in wet lab could find the effect and choose the best of imported exogenous genes but take a long period of time. gNap utilizes Internet databases to construct a genetic regulatory network (GRN) and analyze the effect of exogenous gene by Michaelis-Menten equation and sequence alignment algorithm. Meanwhile, to guide wet lab experimenters to find the best imported gene in the whole GRN, we use PSO method to figure out the best regulation patterns of new imported genes meeting experimenters’ goal.

","Hoping to generate a more direct rational circuit design, we develop BioBLESS that can automatically computes the structure of a digital gene circuit. Instead of looking for a general solution to the computational design challenge, we focus on digital circuits. Given a truth table where the inputs and outputs of Boolean gates take only 0/1 values, we convert it into Boolean Formula and get possible circuit schemes. To get reliable circuits, we select well-behaved circuits with the introduction of fitness scores which sufficiently consider the practical realizablity. Performance simulation and robustness analysis constituting the core of our evaluation module will shed light on how our devised circuits behave and examine the correspondence with truth tables. Moreover, our software keeps the compatibility of various methods or algorithms and reserves the space for users to redesign.

","How do Zebrafish get their stripes? Why do we have only 5 digits on each hand? 
Here's one possible answer: Turing Pattern. 
Turing Pattern is a type of spatial pattern suggested by the British mathematician Alan Turing. He proposed that these patterns could be created by the network of two chemicals which have different diffusion rates. 
This mechanism has been investigated for a long time. However, it was not easy to 
analyze patterns found on living systems because of its complexity and technical difficulty.
We therefore reconstructed a Turing system using two advantages of synthetic biology; controllability and biological directness. By letting whole E. coli cells, whose motility were controlled, communicate with each other, we designed a system that works more ideally than any previous researches.

","Like begets like. It is said that all living things inherit gene from their ancestors thus they resemble their ancestor. In some cases, however, this point of view is not appropriate to describe lives. DNA sequences are not the sole factor which decides how an organism lives. Other factors are also able to control phenotype beyond generations. The purpose of our project is creating a genetic circuit functional in E. coli which allows E. coli to switch or loop back its gene expression and phenotype when each cell division takes place. This will be achieved by the use of the nrd promoter to sense to cell division, three types of sets of sigma factor/anti-sigma factor/sigma promoter control transcription orthogonally to make 3 states of gene expression, and a toehold switch to create an AND gate required in the circuit.

First, we altered the broad-host range vector pRL1383a to comply with BioBrick standards and enable use of BioBrick constructs in organisms like Pseudomonas putida, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and Synechocystis PCC6803. This vector will facilitate exploitation of advantageous characteristics of these organisms, such as photosynthetic carbon assimilation. ?Following expression, product recovery poses a difficult and expensive challenge. Downstream processing of cellular compounds, like polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), commonly represents more than half of the total production expense. ?To counter this problem, secretion-promoting BioBrick devices were constructed through genetic fusion of signal peptides with protein-coding regions. ?To demonstrate this, the secretion of PHA granule-associated proteins and their affinity to PHA was investigated.

We aim to engineer spider silk genes into E. coli to produce this highly valuable product. Spider silk production in bacteria has been limited due to the highly repetitive nature of the spider silk amino acids in the protein.

These cells use a common second messenger system, calcium ion, which promotes a defined response when an electrical pulse is supplied to them. Nevertheless, these cultures present several technical disadvantages in order to make a handily use of them. Valencia team uses this property on yeast to produce luminescence as a response to electrical stimulus. This project constitutes the first time in which the electrical response of Saccharomyces and its potential applications are going to be tested.

The proposal is that dark yeast cells retain the arriving radiation and heat the surface. But, once the temperature reaches its optimum on the planetary surface the color production should be switched off. In order to achieve that and taking advantage of Synthetic Biology principles, a switch based on prion proteins (on mad yeast!) will be used. The work will be complemented with the implementation of the expression of  LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) 'antifreeze' protein. Summarizing, we are going to build a engineered yeast resistant to temperature changes and able to produce a dark pigment which will be the responsible of a global temperature increase on Mars.

","The time has come for synthetic biology to free itself from the constraints of evolution. As an engineering discipline, synthetic biology depends on its genetically-encoded parts operating in consistent and predictable ways. Yet mutation and evolution break that predictability, altering the system’s behavior in disruptive or even dangerous ways, and selecting against intended transgene function. As long as evolution and mutation are allowed to proceed unchecked, the long-term stability, effectiveness, and safety of any genetic technology are at risk. Our solution began by characterizing a set of mutation-prone “hotspot” nucleotide sequences, which we then applied to create new algorithmic tools for modulating any gene’s susceptibility to mutation without affecting its function. With these tools we have achieved precise and predictable control over the frequency of mutation. Through rational design principles, our works shows that it is possible to counteract even the seemingly inescapable forces of evolution. Score one for engineering.

","Phenylketonuria is a genetically inherited condition which is defined by the inability of a patient to break down an essential amino acid phenylalanine. Due to that, phenylalanine derivatives accumulate in the brain of a patient causing severe mental retardation. The aim of our team is to construct a bacterial probiotic with an enhanced rate of phenylalanine uptake and two independent systems for discharging phenylalanine. The first system will metabolize phenylalanine directly in the intestinal tract with phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) whilst the second system will incorporate excess phenylalanine into inclusion bodies made of synthetic phenylalnine-rich proteins. The production of these proteins is controlled by a postranscriptional regulator - a riboswitch, which is sensitive to phenylalanine. The final stage of the project will include verification of the system in a bacterial probiotic strain.

","As many as 137 million people in 70 countries may be affected by groundwater contaminated with arsenic. Existing treatment options are too expensive for the majority of affected areas. Therefore we are developing a bioremediation tool using Escherichia coli to absorb and bind arsenic and remove it from its surrounding environment. Natural and synthetic peptides are employed to sequester the toxic ions and a pump knockout ensures that arsenic stays in the cell. Measurement of growth capacity of the engineered strain in arsenic containing media and quantitative analysis of arsenic sequestration will be performed. Characterization and integration of an arsenic-responsive promoter will allow the sequestration system to dynamically adjust to current conditions. A simple, well-implemented system for biosequestration of arsenic may become part of a solution to a problem denying access to clean drinking water for many.

Although tissue engineering has offered several effective solutions to address the first two processes, our project attempts to build upon these ideas and develop a more cost-effective and robust method to promote angiogenesis at traumatic wound sites.  We have devised a circuit to be incorporated in a yeast chassis that efficiently expresses two vital angiogenic proteins--vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-B)--in a sequential and time-dependent manner that approximates the natural cascade of growth factor release in the human body.

Current diagnostic procedures are complicated, costly, and can take up to a week, by which time the disease may have progressed or spread. The enormous impact of this disease urgently motivates the development of a faster, cheaper, and more reliable diagnostic test. Our epidemiology models suggest that earlier diagnosis could drastically reduce the incidence and impact of the disease. We propose an engineered bacteriophage diagnostic system for rapid clinical detection of pertussis. We first engineered T7 bacteriophage to demonstrate this approach in E. coli. Our modular diagnostic approach can be applied to the high-sensitivity detection of other bacteria.

Of the 100 million U.S. hyperglycemic patients, twenty-six percent regulate spikes through self-administered insulin, which is costly or easily misdosed. To reduce the amplitude of PGSs, we designed a sugar-concentration-dependent microbial system that delays and reduces the absorption of glucose and fructose from the small intestine. To show proof of principle, we introduced two genetic devices into E.coli to polymerize glucose into glycogen, to polymerize fructose into levan, and to induce cell lysis to release the polymerized sugar into the gut, thus reducing the amplitude of the glycemic spike. This microbial system, as a one-dose-fits-all solution, dynamically adjusts to glycemic spikes of fluctuating amplitudes.

","Synthetic biologists struggle to prevent the proliferation of genetically engineered organisms (GEOs) in natural systems. Containment methods that operate in ecological settings must provide security comparable to physical containment. Current methods fail to effectively inhibit horizontal gene transfer and environmental supplementation, and impose evolutionary pressure through the propagation of spontaneous revertants. Synthetic Translational Control (STC) currently utilizes a redesigned leucyl-tRNA synthetase and cleavage enzyme in an E. coli chassis to confer metabolic dependence on a synthetically modified leucine capable of conversion to L-leucine. Due to the semi-semantic property of this device, organisms cannot metabolically bypass our constraints using environmental supplementation and will display greater resistance to evolutionary escape relative to traditional synthetic auxotrophs. Our work provides advancement in biosafety by isolating GEOs from the environment via a reliance on modified metabolites. STC will become a benchmark for biocontainment devices and will allow for countless new applications in synthetic biology.

","The abundance and diversity of our food relies on honeybee pollination. Varroa destructor mites weaken bee colonies through the spread of disease. Our team aims to save bees by killing Varroa using bacteria inside beehives. In continuous conversation with beekeepers and scientists we develop a bacterium that targets mites, leaving bees and humans unaffected. The hive-localized bacteria sense Varroa and produce mite-specific toxin, eliminating the need for beekeepers to dose the product. The bacteria are dependent on a synthetic amino acid and are shut down by light to confine them to the hive. Additionally, we develop an in vitro test of Varroa toxicity to show the utility of our bacterium. The system is modeled in various ways to assess its viability in the real world. This is the first effective method to combine specificity, ease of use, safety through bio-containment, and the iGEM open source character to save the honeybee.

","For the Biohawks iGEM team, our primary goal is to develop an organic, safe stain remover for commonplace applications. By transforming bacteria to manufacture an enzyme that breaks down common proteins, we hope to present a new alternative to marketed removal products, which contain harsh chemicals. In theory, many enzymes could be used, varying in function to break-down different molecules such as cellulose in plant-based stains, lipids in oil stains, starches in condiment stains, and so on. However, not all enzymes can be used, as the integrity of the clothing must be preserved and the user must be kept safe from harm.  Some enzymes or solutions can cause epidermal damage or respiratory problems.  Our goal, using the enzyme subtilisin, is to remove protein-based stains and create a substitute for potent chemicals with a green solution for the 21st century.

When in endosome, pH-dependent two-component regulatory system activity enables the bacterium to escape to cytoplasm. Once the bacterium is in the cytoplasm some proteins are secreted due to expression of specific genes. In our case, secretion of p53 or bax proteins to mitochondria leads to apoptosis without cell cycle arrest thus enabling complementation of traditional chemotherapeutical agents, which affect only proliferating cells.

","Our project consists of two parts: BactoDHL and RBS Measurement. BactoDHL is a universal platform for protein and DNA delivery to the mammalian cells. It's based on E. coli strain expressing invasion determinants: invasin from Yersinia pestis and listeriolysin (LLO) from Listeria monocytogenes. Invasin causes uptake of the bacterium into the mammalian cell by induction of endocytosis. Bacterial cells are lysed in the endosome and then LLO is released. LLO is a pore-forming toxin which causes endosomal membrane disruption and release of the payload (either protein or DNA) into cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. In order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we conducted measurement of various RBS parts included in 2010 spring distribution both from Community and Anderson's collections. We used standard measurement kit composed of promoter BBa_J23100 and GFP+terminator part BBa_I130401. We performed both relative and absolute RBS strength measurement.

Our team sought to improve on a previous light-regulated gene expression method, integrate the use of tablet device for testing, and create multiple functional biobrick constructs. In 2012, we developed an app that affords any researcher with access to an android device with a LED screen the ability to illuminate cells in a controlled manner for synthetic biology applications. We improved the functionality of the app by adding a mini petri dish setting and demonstrated the advantages of paralization by performing experiments in a 96 well plate format. This tablet application represents the first real life example of using a mobile device as synthetic biology instrument.

","Stabilizing proteins is an incredibly important and time consuming task in the field of protein engineering. Our team has developed a high throughput method to select for the increased expression and stability of engineered proteins, making them more amenable to large-scale production in Escherichia coli and other downstream applications. Our method involves the insertion of proteins into a Gal4-VP16 transactivator that binds a promoter directly upstream of a GFP gene. This allows for the subsequent selection of mutants associated with higher GFP output, correlating to higher stability, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Additionally, our method utilizes degrons to alter the dynamic range of this GFP output. This revolutionary method is a potentially generalizable alternative to current, labor intensive approaches for the selection of stable protein variants. Engineered proteins selected through this method could be produced in bacteria and aid in the development of thermostable, de novo protein therapeutics.

","Photosynthetic light harvesting antennas function to collect light and transfer energy to a reaction center for photochemistry. Phototrophs evolved large antennas to compete for photons in natural environments where light is scarce.  Consequently, cells at the surface of photobioreactors over-absorb light, leading to attenuated photobioreactor light penetration and starving cells on the interior of photons. This reduction of photosynthetic productivity has been identified as the primary impediment to improving photobioreactor efficiency.  While reduction of antenna size improves photosynthetic productivity, current approaches to this end uniformly truncate antennas and are difficult to manipulate from the perspective of bioengineering. We aim to create a modifiable system to optimize antenna size throughout the bioreactor by utilizing a synthetic regulatory mechanism that correlates expression of the pucB/A LH2 antenna genes with incident light intensity. This new application of synthetic biology serves to transform the science of antenna reduction into the engineering of antenna optimization.

They sicken cells by aggregating with each other and prevent proper protein folding leading to cell death from the accumulated damage. We propose a synthetic biology approach to better study prion propagation in the model organism S. cerevisiae. Our system involves inserting a premature stop codon into a protein open reading frame of interest or into dCas9 to respectively overexpress or knock-down protein levels during a [PSI+] response. We use Hsp104, a chaperone protein in S. cerevisiae, to demonstrate that our set-up phenotypically responds to the stop codon readthrough. This research is useful for continuously observing a phenotypic output during prion propagation in yeast and may have implications for helping to identify protein targets for both prevention and treatment of NDDs in the future.

In addition to having high proliferation rates, CSCs are more resistant to chemotherapy. This indicates that while regular cancer cells are killed, CSCs may remain unaffected and give rise to new tumors once the treatment stops. 

CSCs produce increased levels of a particular enzyme, Aldehyde Dehydrogenase.

West Point's 2011 iGEM team is developing a simple test kit to determine the presence of cholera contamination in drinking water. Inserting a plasmid coding for Beta-Galactosidase (_-Gal) enzyme induced by an arabinose promoter (araBAD) into E. coli creates a biological specimen that will produce the _-Gal in the presence of arabinose.  When the modified specimen is mixed with cholera the _-Gal is released into solution where it reacts with X-gal, also in the solution, producing a blue-violet color.  If no cholera is present, the solution remains clear.

Although the WHO and EPA both recommend a maximum level of contamination of 10 ppb, many areas, like West Bengal and Bangladesh, have a much more relaxed 50 ppb.

","Biofuels represent a potential solution to current world energy demands. Total crude oil replacement based on a 20% fuel titer and current fuel demands would require 5.6 trillion gallons of fresh water per year. Current fresh water supplies may not support this added demand. Alternatively, a sustainable approach may use a portion of the Earth’s 3.5x1020 gallons of ocean water. However, current fuel-producing organisms are unable to thrive in ocean-level osmolarities. Glycine betaine, a powerful osmoprotectant, shields organisms from salt-induced stress.  Wild-type Escherichia coli can acquire glycine betaine from their surroundings or synthesize it from environmental choline.  Two enzymes, glycine/sarcosine methyltransferase, and sarcosine/dimethyglycine methyltransferase, catalyze three successive methylations of glycine for de novo synthesis of glycine betaine.  Here, we demonstrate an engineered E. coli with an increased growth rate under salt induced stress.  We highlight utility by demonstrating the improved growth of fuel producing bacteria in ocean water.

Once the Lactobacillus acidophilus has reached the duodenum, they will lyse by either by a timed inducible/repressible system, a bile-inducible system, or an encryption system. Using DNA we can mimic the functionality of a combination lock, and produce a 'locked' gene, which can be effectively 'unlocked' only after a specific sequence of inputs. Since DNA functions as a logical medium, the 'locked' and 'unlocked' states are heritable, which makes this system useful as the computational basis for many higher-order genetic devices from bacterial calculators to engineering of new metabolic pathways to bacterial drug delivery systems.

Through expression of heterologous genes, E. coli strains which appear to have a response to a specific biofuel were generated. However, these biosensors did not produce the low uninduced and high induced levels of expression desired. This situation appears to be common among biosensor-based iGEM projects. In order to improve the biofuel sensors, as well as provide a framework for other teams to do the same, a universal biosensor directed evolution construct was assembled.

To address this issue, we have constructed a BioFusion compatible system for testing the translation of a gene of interest. This system couples the translation of the target gene to a fluorescent reporter gene. Fluorescence will only be detected when the target gene is entirely translated. This construct enables synthetic biologists to quickly determine if a gene is being expressed without the need for costly antibodies or analytical instruments (e.g. mass spectrometry).

Two riboswitches were used to control the translation of a CheZ fluorescent protein fusion, the first sensitive to theophylline and the second to atrazine. Fluorometry was used to prove the activation of the riboswitches. A theophylline concentration of 1.5mM resulted in the highest expression of the fusion protein.

Over-prescription of antibiotics promotes resistance in both livestock pathogens and natural flora, which can be transmitted to humans through meat and other products.
A cheap, quick, and reliable mechanism for detecting and identifying infection is one solution to this problem. We developed an E.coli based cell surface antigen expression system that can be utilized as a diagnostic tool for nearly any viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.

","Nonsense and missense mutations cause numerous incurable diseases, including Cystic Fibrosis and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, that affect millions of people worldwide. Gene therapy is the most promising treatment for these genetics diseases. The majority of current gene therapy techniques focus on correction of DNA sequences; our project focuses on direct editing of RNA sequences. Targeting RNA is advantageous because it permits a tunable and reversible editing system that can repair multiple mutations while circumventing the process of homology directed repair. We have constructed dCas9 fusions to the editing enzymes APOBEC1 and ADAR1/2 to enable CRISPR-targeted C-to-U and A-to-I edits to RNA, respectively. We have designed and thoroughly characterized a series of GFP-based reporters that enable the detection and quantification of RNA editing by these dCas9 fusions. Our project outlines the theoretical framework for a novel, tunable, and reversible gene editing strategy with myriad applications.

Currently, fuel cells do not produce sufficient power to be used for household appliances. Our genetically engineered organism will help us change this and be the first step in the Renewable Revolution. 
Bacteria are the most abundant form of life on Earth, they survive in harsh environments and they divide rapidly. Thus, they can be a renewable, sustainable source of energy. Our organism will deposit gold nanoparticles on the battery to increase its conductivity. These gold ions come from toxic pharmaceutical waste which is extremely harmful to the environment.

","Currently, biotechnology in Latin America faces constraints that limit their social acceptance, mainly due to a lack of or distortion of information available to the general public. The team will first determine the perception of biotechnology undergraduate students through a survey developed for this purpose.  Second, we will coordinate and conduct education and information activities with children and youth using synthetic biology activities with the goal to publicize scientific and timely information about this technology.  Finally, we will conduct a risk analysis of the E zamofordi organism by the Cartegena Protocol and the Environmental Risk Assessment of genetically modified organisms’ guidelines (ERA).  With these we will scientifically demonstrate that the project ¨Know your enemy¨ complies with the established norms of biosafety.  If handled according to relevant regulations, as an alternate product through the extrapolation of this evaluation, this is a simple tool for future risk analysis applicable to Central America.

","Rainbofilm is a stratified expression system in biofilm, a self-organized module extensible for various needs. Researchers found a vertical oxygen gradient establishes in the biofilm. Such property allows us to use oxygen sensitive promoters to artificially induce differentiated functions through the spatial distribution of cells. Thus, the multi-step reaction can be processed within the different layers of the biofilm.The biofilm and its layered structure form spontaneously. Also biofilm has the natural resistance to high levels of toxin. These two properties render the Rainbofilm a convenient stable system for bio-production and bio-sensor. The system can cater to different needs simply by changing downstream genes. One possible application is ethanol production. The cellulose is degraded to monose from the bottom to the middle layer, and the ethanol is produced and secreted in the surface to minimize the toxicity to the inner cells.

","While former iGEM software teams were mainly focusing on the assembly of biobricks into a predictable system, our software Bach targets at the coding sequence of biobrick itself. We first built a mathematical model to quantitatively predict RIPS (ribosome initiation per sec) of any given coding sequence in any organism. We then constructed three modules (synonymous substitution, optimization and RIPS design) to process input coding sequences. Bach could recompose the input sequence into an output one that better suits the host organism and performs the specific translational rate of desire. In this way, the discordant tunes of codon bias in biobricks from different genetic backgrounds could be synchronized, and the realization of a more predictable and robust system would be possible. Our work not only benefits current works involving exogenous protein expression, but also makes a big step towards standardization and characterization of biobricks.

","ZJU-China aims to design and realize a tunable RNA scaffold to accelerate biological pathways and turn their on and off. RNA scaffold is designed to colocalize enzymes through interactions between binding domains on the scaffold and target peptides fused to each enzyme in engineered biological pathways in vivo, which may suffered from low efficiency of production caused by relative lack of spatial organization of non-homologous enzymes. The scaffold allows efficient channeling of substrates to products over several enzymatic steps by limiting the diffusion of intermediates thus providing a bright future for solving the problem. Meanwhile, we plan to add an aptamer structure on RNA scaffold as a switch to regulate biological pathways by micromolecular ligands. Then we can control the all-or-none binding relationship between the enzymes and scaffold by whether the special ligands are presented or not.

","This year we aim to utilize aptamer to specifically detect and clear molecules of different sizes. In order to detect and clear certain protein, we make tunneled E.coli called bacterial ghost that allow protein to diffuse in. We then build two types of inner-membrane protein scaffold, which will dimerize when pulled together by two aptamers attached to two sites of the protein. The dimerized proteins have enzymatic activity that can be detected via commercial test strips. The device will also sequester the proteins and allow us to clear them. In order to efficiently detect and clear a small molecule called atrazine, which is an herbicide causing tremendous environmental problems, we split our aptamer-based detection module and clear module into two strains. The first strain is chemotaxic to atrazine and will release quorum sensing molecules to attract the second strain, which contains atrazine hydrolase to clear it.

","The assembly of genetic circuits is a huge obstacle between designs and achievements in synthetic biology. Many well-known methods, from traditional restriction digestion & ligation, 3A assembly to Gibson assembly, aim to overcome the difficulties but unfortunately get respective defects. This year, ZJU-CHINA seeks to build a gene-insertion system in bacterial chromosome, ""GeneSocket"". Clearly different from the in vitro constructing methods mentioned before, GeneSocket, which can be easily combined with existing in vitro methods, makes gene expression more accurate, stable and controllable by assembling genetic elements in chromosome directly.

Two core methods, lambda red recombination and recombinase-based bistable switch, are applied. Both are the best choices for achieving the characteristics of GeneSocket.

We hope that by using GeneSocket, synthetic biologists can turn their theoretical design into reality faster and better. We want to lead to the revolution in techniques of synthetic biology!

","The aim of our project is to create a brand-new system to kill termites.
We chose two kinds of toxins which are safe and environmentally friendly to eliminate termites. We have cloned genes coding insecticidal toxic proteins from Photorhabdus luminescens TT01, a bacteria poisonous to numerous insects, and express them in E.coli. We enhance the production of Avermectin in S.A. 

Then, we prepared cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , and generated the nanofibrous microspheres (NCM) self-assembled from CNC as bacteria carriers, in order to reduce the loss, improve transport efficiency, and target the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment. 
Finally, a series of simulation experiments have been conducted. They can help us to understand  the  cellulase, and confirm the terminator are efficient. Based on the result of simulation, we improved a device to monitor and terminate termites for better achieving.

","Synthetic genetic oscillators have long been of interest to the scientific community. Our team has constructed a special oscillator gene circuit manipulating two quorum sensing autoinducers to change periodically, and reach their peak value alternately. Inspired by Enigma machine, we intend to use our oscillator circuit to make a biological cipher machine, which is able to encrypt and decipher information consisting of two basic elements. In our design, blue and red fluorescence stand for two basic elements of input and output. When one protein reaches its threshold value, a corresponding gene circuit will be triggered, either to retain the original element, or to change it to the other one. Using this method, we could realize the periodic conversion of a code book, which is hard to be deciphered. We hope this design can be an innovative attempt to apply synthetic biology to information safety from the aspect of interdiscipline.
