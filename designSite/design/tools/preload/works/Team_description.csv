LaVerne-Leos,2015,Using Zeaxanthin and Tocopherol to protect cyanobacteria from the toxic effects of free fatty acids,"Free fatty acids are biofuel precursors. We focused on using zeaxanthin to counter the toxic effects of increased free fatty acids in an altered Synechococcus elongatus 7942 strain. Zeaxanthin acts as an antioxidant, stabilizes the membrane, and is needed for electron transport chain function. To increase the concentration of zeaxanthin and its precursors, we introduced a circuit containing parts of the zeaxanthin synthesis pathway. The La Ca?ada subset of our team focused on tocopherol, a metabolite that has similar properties to zeaxanthin in cyanobacteria. Tocopherol acts as an antioxidant, protects the cell from lipid peroxidation, and enhances photosynthesis. A circuit was made with the gene p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase to catalyze the formation of homogenistic acid, the rate limiting step of tocopherol synthesis. In an attempt to further increase the production of fatty acids, both zeaxanthin and tocopherol circuits are dynamically regulated, utilizing a fatty acid-sensitive promoter-repressor system, pLR and FadR.",Fatty acid; Zeaxanthin; Tocopherols ,E. coli; Cyanobacteria

Purdue,2015,Development of Synthetic Yeast for Enzymatic Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic Biomass,"The production of some biofuels is inhibited by lignin, a complex organic polymer which physically blocks carbohydrate substrates and inhibits biomass degrading enzymes (BDEs). A common biofuel practice is to sequester lignin using energy-intensive thermal pretreatment. The recent development of a synthetic yeast that spatially separates lignin degradation products from vulnerable BDEs enables an efficient lignin breakdown system to reduce the energy input for biofuel production. By expressing enzymes from lignin-degrading species (termites and white rot fungi), we aim to establish a novel enzymatic pretreatment system in a yeast chassis. Six enzymes were selected for their ability to operate at room temperature and standard pH. The expressed enzymes were evaluated individually and in combination for lignin-degradation efficiency.

UNITN-Trento,2015,optimize MFC’s platform using an engineered E. coli that exploits sunlight to live better under stressful conditions and that has an increased electron production.,"Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) technology is rapidly evolving due to interest in producing sustainable electricity. Typically, MFCs exploit complex mixtures of microorganisms in which the identity of the microorganisms are unknown. The undefined nature of the source of electrons leads to limitations in the control and optimization of the MFC. We, therefore, attempted to improve the MFC platform by exclusively using E. coli engineered to survive under stressful conditions. E. coli cells were modified to express a light-driven proton pump, which required the assembly of a cofactor synthesis pathway. The proton gradient generated upon the exposure of light was then used by the bacteria to synthesize ATP, thereby turning E. coli into a type of pseudo-autotroph. Furthermore we investigated different genetic approaches to improve the secretion of electrons from E. coli. We built an MFC prototype with our engineered bacteria that are driven by light, which we called “Solar pMFC.”",Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs); SUNLIGHT POWER,E. coli

Tokyo-NoKoGen,2015,A new system to exterminate termites using engineered E. coli and pseudo egg,"""ExTermite coli” is a novel system to exterminate termites, which combines an engineered Escherichia coli and a unique pseudo-egg delivery system. The E. coli was engineered to overexpress glucose-3-dehydrogenase (G3DH), which converts trehalose into the trehalase inhibitor 3,3’-diketo-trehalose (3,3’dkt). Because trehalose is a major termite blood sugar and trehalase is essential for trehalose metabolism, G3DH essentially converts trehalose into an insecticide. The pseudo-egg delivery system takes advantage of a habit termites have of carrying their eggs to their nests and licking them. Termites recognize their eggs by sensing β-glucosidase and lysozyme, which act as egg-recognition pheromones. The pseudo eggs, containing both termite egg-recognition molecules and engineered E. coli, will be delivered to their nests and then licked by the termites present, ththe teamallowing the G3DH produced by the E. coli to convert trehalose into insecticide inside the termite bodies.

BostonU,2015,Developing conditionally dimerizable split protein systems for genetic logic and genome editing applications,"The field of synthetic biology seeks to engineer desirable cellular functionalities by developing molecular technologies that enable precise genetic manipulation. A promising solution is to reliably control proteins that naturally execute genetic modifications. Current strategies to regulate activity of such proteins primarily rely on modulating protein expression level through transcriptional control; however, these methods are susceptible to slow response and leaky expression. In contrast, strategies that exploit post-translational regulation of activity, such as conditional dimerization of split protein halves, have been demonstrated to bypass these limitations. Here, The team compare the relative efficiency of previously characterized dimerization domains in regulating activities of three important genetic manipulation proteins - integrases and recombination directionality factors for genetic logic applications, and saCas9 for in vivo genome editing applications. The team also establish guidelines to rationally identify promising protein split sites. the characterization of these systems in mammalian cells ultimately paves way for important biomedical applications.",Genome manipulation; Genetic logic; Genome editing; Dimerization; Biomedical,E. coli

 Greensboro-Austin,2013, Using an Expanded Genetic Code product bioadhesive.,"Mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) are water-resistant bioadhesives that have a variety of biomedical and construction applications. Replicating the natural properties of MAPs through in vivo production using microbes is difficult as it depends on post-translational modifications, primarily the hydroxylation of tyrosine residues to L-DOPA. Since adhesiveness is correlated with L-DOPA content, the project aims to improve the adhesive properties of MAPs by utilizing a strain which inserts the non-canonical amino acid L-DOPA at UAG stop codons during translation. When combined with the in vivo production of free L-DOPA, this system is a significant step towards rapid, cost-effective MAPs production.

Starting from the NpuDnaE intein RFC circularization construct BioBrick from Team Heidelberg 2014 (BBa_K1362000) they developed a computationally-optimized linker sequence to circularize a Type III antifreeze protein. The BioBrick also added a constitutive T7 promoter allowing expression of circular protein without any additional sub-cloning steps. Type III AFPs have a variety of potential applications in the oil and gas, food, and health industries, but Type III AFP is a particularly fragile protein as it denatures at 37 ℃. Circularizing the protein using the BioBrick affords greater stability at a wider variety of experimental conditions.","antifreeze proteins (AFPs), scaffold",E. coli

NJU-China,2015,a strategy to treat opioid addiction,"The team developed a strategy to treat opioid addiction. They prepared exosomes (nano-sized vesicles secreted by endogenous cells) from cell factory that was engineered to express a rabies viral glycoprotein peptide (specifically recognize and target neuronal cells) on the exosomal membrane surface. By filling the exosomes with siRNA of the mu opioid receptor (MOR, a primary target for opioids) and injecting the exosomes into mouse bloodstream, they detected efficient passage of the siRNA through blood-brain barrier and specific accumulation of the siRNA in mouse brain. Consequently, siRNA-loaded exosomes significantly reduced MOR mRNA and protein levels in mice. To show the therapeutic potential, siRNA-loaded exosomes strongly restrained morphine-induced conditioned place preference in mice. This project may open up new avenues for future treatment of drug addiction.","rabies virus glycoprotein(RVG), Mu opioid receptor (MOR) , miRNA, Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase 2), exosome",HEK293

Sydney_Australia,2015,Synthesising ethylene oxide from ethylene using monooxygenase enzymes in Pseudomonas Putida and E. Coli ,"The enzyme ethene monooxygenase (EtnABCD) catalyses the epoxide reaction that converts ethylene to ethylene oxide by incorporating a hydroxyl group. Mycobacterium smegmatis is the only organism that endogenously expresses ethene monooxygenase, yet is a poor cloning host. To enhance the heterologous expression of the EtnABCD enzyme, a mathematical model was developed taking into account the differences in codon frequencies between organisms. The M. smegmatis gene encoding EtnABCD was modified using this model in order to obtain optimized sequences for expression in both Pseudomonas putida, as an intermediate host, and Escherichia coli. The altered EtnABCD sequences will be cloned into appropriate vector inserts.
